## 1. Definition and Epidemiology

Premature ventricular complexes (PVCs) are early depolarizations originating from the ventricular myocardium. They are among the most common cardiac arrhythmias encountered in clinical practice.

**Prevalence:**
- Found in 1-4% of the general population on standard 12-lead ECG
- Detected in up to 75% of individuals on 24-48 hour Holter monitoring
- Incidence increases with age, occurring more frequently in males
- Most PVCs in structurally normal hearts are benign

**Common origins:**
- Right ventricular outflow tract (RVOT) — most common in structurally normal hearts
- Left ventricular outflow tract (LVOT)
- Aortic cusps
- Papillary muscles
- Fascicular system

## 2. Clinical Presentation

### Symptoms
- Palpitations (most common complaint) — described as "skipped beats," "fluttering," or "pounding"
- Sensation of the heart "stopping" momentarily followed by a strong beat
- Lightheadedness or dizziness (usually transient)
- Chest discomfort or tightness
- Anxiety related to awareness of irregular heartbeats
- Fatigue (especially with frequent PVCs)
- Many patients are completely asymptomatic

### History-Taking Key Points
- Frequency and duration of symptoms
- Triggers: caffeine, alcohol, stress, sleep deprivation, exercise
- Associated symptoms suggesting structural heart disease
- Medication and supplement use (stimulants, decongestants)
- Family history of sudden cardiac death or cardiomyopathy

## 3. Diagnostic Workup

### Initial Assessment
1. **12-lead ECG** — morphology helps localize origin; LBBB pattern suggests RV origin, RBBB suggests LV origin
2. **24-48 hour Holter monitor** — quantifies PVC burden (total PVCs / total heartbeats)
3. **Echocardiogram** — assess LV function, wall motion, structural abnormalities
4. **Basic labs** — electrolytes (K+, Mg2+), thyroid function (TSH), CBC

### Extended Workup (when indicated)
- **Cardiac MRI** — if structural heart disease suspected, evaluate for ARVC, myocarditis, sarcoidosis
- **Exercise stress test** — assess PVC behavior with exertion; suppression with exercise is generally reassuring
- **Event monitor or implantable loop recorder** — for intermittent symptoms not captured on Holter

### PVC Burden Assessment
- **PVC burden** = (number of PVCs / total heartbeats) x 100% over 24 hours
- Burden < 5%: Generally considered low; rarely causes LV dysfunction
- Burden 10-15%: Moderate; warrants monitoring of LV function
- Burden > 15-20%: High; significant risk of PVC-induced cardiomyopathy
- Burden > 24%: Very high; strong association with LV dysfunction

## 4. Risk Stratification

### Low Risk (Reassurance + Monitoring)
- Asymptomatic or mildly symptomatic PVCs
- PVC burden < 10%
- Normal LV function on echocardiogram
- Unifocal PVC morphology
- PVCs that suppress with exercise
- No family history of sudden cardiac death

### Moderate Risk (Consider Treatment)
- Symptomatic PVCs affecting quality of life
- PVC burden 10-20%
- Borderline or declining LV function
- Frequent couplets or short runs of NSVT

### High Risk (Active Treatment Recommended)
- PVC burden > 20%
- LV dysfunction (EF < 50%) attributed to PVCs
- Sustained ventricular tachycardia
- PVCs worsening with exercise
- Structural heart disease present
- Syncope or presyncope

## 5. Treatment Approach

### Step 1: Lifestyle Modifications (All Patients)
- Reduce or eliminate caffeine intake
- Limit alcohol consumption
- Ensure adequate sleep (7-9 hours)
- Manage stress (mindfulness, exercise, therapy)
- Stay well-hydrated; maintain electrolyte balance
- Regular moderate exercise (unless contraindicated)
- Avoid known triggers (decongestants, energy drinks)

### Step 2: Pharmacotherapy

#### First-Line: Beta-Blockers
Beta-blockers are the standard first-line pharmacotherapy for symptomatic PVCs.

**Commonly used agents:**
- **Metoprolol succinate** (extended-release): 25-200 mg daily
- **Propranolol**: 20-40 mg two to three times daily (or LA 60-160 mg daily)
- **Bisoprolol**: 2.5-10 mg daily
- **Atenolol**: 25-100 mg daily

**Why beta-blockers work for PVCs:**
- Reduce sympathetic drive that triggers ectopic foci
- Decrease automaticity of ventricular cells
- Slow heart rate, reducing the "window" for premature beats
- Reduce myocardial oxygen demand

**Expected response:**
- 50-70% reduction in PVC frequency in responsive patients
- Symptom improvement may precede PVC count reduction
- Full effect typically seen within 2-4 weeks at therapeutic dose
- Not all patients respond; some PVCs are not catecholamine-sensitive

#### Second-Line: Calcium Channel Blockers (Non-Dihydropyridine)
- **Verapamil** or **diltiazem** — for PVCs not responsive to beta-blockers
- Particularly effective for fascicular PVCs and some idiopathic LV PVCs
- Useful when beta-blockers are contraindicated (reactive airway disease)

#### Third-Line: Antiarrhythmic Drugs
- **Flecainide** — Class IC; effective but requires structurally normal heart
- **Propafenone** — Class IC; similar efficacy to flecainide
- **Amiodarone** — Class III; most effective but significant side effect profile; reserved for refractory cases
- **Sotalol** — Combined beta-blocker + Class III; requires QTc monitoring

### Step 3: Catheter Ablation
- Indicated for drug-refractory symptomatic PVCs
- Indicated for PVC-induced cardiomyopathy
- Success rates: 80-90% for RVOT origin, 70-85% for other locations
- Low complication rate in experienced centers
- Can be curative; allows discontinuation of medications

## 6. PVC-Induced Cardiomyopathy

### Definition
A reversible form of dilated cardiomyopathy caused by frequent PVCs, where elimination of PVCs leads to recovery of LV function.

### Key Features
- PVC burden typically > 15-24% (though lower burdens can cause it in susceptible individuals)
- LV ejection fraction reduced (< 50%)
- LV dilation may be present
- No other identifiable cause of cardiomyopathy
- Potentially fully reversible with successful PVC elimination

### Mechanism
- Chronic ventricular dyssynchrony from PVCs
- Increased myocardial oxygen demand
- Abnormal calcium handling in cardiomyocytes
- Chronic sympathetic activation
- Progressive myocardial fibrosis if untreated

### Recovery After Treatment
- LV function typically begins improving within 1-3 months of PVC elimination
- Full recovery may take 6-12 months
- Some patients may have residual LV dysfunction if treated late
- Monitoring: Repeat echocardiogram at 3 and 6 months post-treatment

## 7. Monitoring Protocol

### For Low-Burden, Benign PVCs
- Annual clinical follow-up
- Repeat Holter if symptoms change
- Echocardiogram every 1-2 years if burden > 5%

### For Patients on Beta-Blocker Therapy
- Follow-up at 2-4 weeks after starting medication
- Check heart rate, blood pressure, symptoms
- Repeat Holter at 4-8 weeks to assess PVC burden reduction
- Echocardiogram at 6 months if initial burden was > 10%
- Monitor for beta-blocker side effects: fatigue, bradycardia, hypotension, depression

### For PVC-Induced Cardiomyopathy
- Serial echocardiograms: 1, 3, 6, and 12 months after treatment
- Repeat Holter to confirm PVC suppression
- Consider cardiac MRI if LV function does not recover as expected

## 8. Red Flags Requiring Urgent Evaluation

Patients should be counseled to seek immediate medical attention for:
- Sustained rapid heart rate lasting > 30 seconds
- Syncope (fainting) or near-syncope
- Severe chest pain
- Shortness of breath at rest
- PVCs with exertion causing dizziness or presyncope
- New or worsening heart failure symptoms (leg swelling, orthopnea)

## 9. Patient Counseling Points

### Reassurance
- Isolated PVCs in a structurally normal heart have an excellent prognosis
- PVCs are not inherently dangerous in the absence of structural heart disease
- The sensation of PVCs is often more distressing than the rhythm itself
- Many people have PVCs without ever being aware of them

### Lifestyle Advice
- Caffeine reduction is the single most impactful modifiable trigger
- Regular exercise is beneficial and safe for most PVC patients
- Sleep quality has a significant impact on PVC frequency
- Anxiety about PVCs can itself increase PVC frequency (catecholamine surge)

### Medication Adherence
- Beta-blockers should not be stopped abruptly (risk of rebound tachycardia)
- Report side effects rather than discontinuing medication independently
- Full benefit of medication may take several weeks to manifest
- Consistency in timing of medication improves efficacy
