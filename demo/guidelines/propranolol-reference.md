## 1. Drug Identity

- **Generic name:** Propranolol hydrochloride
- **Drug class:** Non-selective beta-adrenergic antagonist (beta-blocker)
- **Available forms:** Immediate-release tablets (10, 20, 40, 60, 80 mg); Extended-release capsules (60, 80, 120, 160 mg); Oral solution; Injectable
- **Common brand names:** Inderal, Inderal LA, InnoPran XL, Hemangeol

## 2. Mechanism of Action

Propranolol competitively blocks both beta-1 and beta-2 adrenergic receptors:

- **Beta-1 blockade (cardiac):**
  - Reduces heart rate (negative chronotropy)
  - Decreases force of myocardial contraction (negative inotropy)
  - Slows AV nodal conduction (negative dromotropy)
  - Reduces myocardial oxygen demand
  - Decreases automaticity of ectopic foci (antiarrhythmic effect)

- **Beta-2 blockade (peripheral):**
  - Bronchoconstriction (clinically relevant in asthma/COPD)
  - Peripheral vasoconstriction (may cause cold extremities)
  - May mask hypoglycemic symptoms (tremor, tachycardia)
  - Inhibits glycogenolysis

- **Additional properties:**
  - Membrane-stabilizing activity at higher doses
  - Lipophilic — crosses blood-brain barrier (relevant for CNS effects like anxiety reduction, migraine prevention)
  - No intrinsic sympathomimetic activity (ISA)

## 3. Approved Indications

- Hypertension
- Angina pectoris (chronic stable)
- Atrial fibrillation (rate control)
- Cardiac arrhythmias (including supraventricular and ventricular arrhythmias, PVCs)
- Myocardial infarction (secondary prevention)
- Essential tremor
- Pheochromocytoma (adjunctive, with alpha-blocker)
- Migraine prophylaxis
- Hypertrophic subaortic stenosis
- Infantile hemangioma (oral solution)

## 4. Use in PVC Management

### Rationale
Propranolol's non-selective beta-blockade reduces sympathetically mediated ectopic activity. Its lipophilicity allows CNS penetration, which may additionally help patients whose PVCs are exacerbated by anxiety.

### Dosing for PVCs
- **Starting dose:** 10-20 mg two to three times daily
- **Typical maintenance:** 20-40 mg two to three times daily
- **Maximum dose:** 320 mg/day in divided doses (rarely needed for PVCs)
- **Extended-release alternative:** 60-160 mg once daily (for adherence)

### Dose Titration Protocol
1. Start at lowest dose (10 mg TID or 20 mg BID)
2. Assess response at 1-2 weeks (symptoms + heart rate)
3. Increase by 20 mg/day increments every 1-2 weeks as tolerated
4. Target resting heart rate: 60-70 bpm
5. If adequate symptom control achieved, maintain current dose
6. Monitor blood pressure (target: avoid symptomatic hypotension)

## 5. Pharmacokinetics

| Parameter | Immediate Release | Extended Release |
|-----------|------------------|-----------------|
| Absorption | Rapid, nearly complete | Slow, sustained |
| Bioavailability | ~25% (high first-pass) | ~25% |
| Peak plasma level | 1-4 hours | 6 hours |
| Half-life | 3-6 hours | 8-11 hours |
| Protein binding | ~90% (albumin) | ~90% |
| Metabolism | Hepatic (CYP2D6, CYP1A2) | Same |
| Active metabolites | 4-hydroxypropranolol | Same |
| Excretion | Renal (< 1% unchanged) | Same |

**Key pharmacokinetic notes:**
- Highly lipophilic — extensive tissue distribution, crosses BBB
- Significant first-pass metabolism (only ~25% reaches systemic circulation)
- Food increases bioavailability — take consistently with or without food
- CYP2D6 poor metabolizers may have higher plasma levels

## 6. Common Side Effects

### Cardiovascular (5-15%)
- **Bradycardia** — most common; dose-dependent
- **Hypotension** — especially postural; more common in elderly
- **Cold extremities** — due to beta-2 mediated peripheral vasoconstriction
- **Worsening of Raynaud phenomenon**

### Central Nervous System (5-10%)
- **Fatigue** — most frequently reported side effect
- **Dizziness** — usually early in treatment
- **Sleep disturbances** — vivid dreams, insomnia (due to CNS penetration)
- **Depression** — reported but causality debated in literature

### Gastrointestinal (2-5%)
- Nausea
- Diarrhea or constipation
- Abdominal discomfort

### Metabolic
- Weight gain (typically 1-2 kg)
- May mask symptoms of hypoglycemia (important in diabetic patients)
- May elevate triglycerides / decrease HDL

### Respiratory
- Bronchospasm — particularly in patients with reactive airway disease
- Dyspnea — uncommon at standard doses in patients without lung disease

### Sexual
- Erectile dysfunction (2-5%, less common than with atenolol)
- Decreased libido

## 7. Serious Adverse Effects

- **Severe bradycardia** (HR < 45 bpm) — requires dose reduction or discontinuation
- **Heart block** (second or third degree) — contraindicated if pre-existing
- **Acute bronchospasm** — in susceptible patients (asthma, severe COPD)
- **Worsening heart failure** — negative inotropy can decompensate borderline HF
- **Rebound phenomenon** — abrupt discontinuation can cause rebound tachycardia, hypertension, worsening angina, and rarely MI

## 8. Contraindications

### Absolute
- Cardiogenic shock
- Sinus bradycardia (HR < 50 bpm, symptomatic)
- Heart block greater than first degree (without pacemaker)
- Uncompensated heart failure
- Bronchial asthma or severe COPD with bronchospasm
- Known hypersensitivity to propranolol

### Relative
- Diabetes mellitus (especially insulin-dependent — masks hypoglycemia)
- Peripheral vascular disease
- Mild-moderate COPD without bronchospasm
- Depression (risk of exacerbation)
- Hepatic impairment (may need dose reduction)
- Concurrent use of verapamil or diltiazem (risk of severe bradycardia/AV block)

## 9. Drug Interactions

### Major Interactions
| Drug/Class | Effect | Management |
|-----------|--------|------------|
| Verapamil, Diltiazem | Severe bradycardia, AV block, hypotension | Avoid combination or use extreme caution |
| Clonidine | Rebound hypertension if clonidine stopped | Discontinue propranolol first, then taper clonidine |
| Insulin, Sulfonylureas | Masked hypoglycemia, prolonged recovery | Monitor glucose closely; educate patient on non-adrenergic symptoms |
| CYP2D6 inhibitors (fluoxetine, paroxetine) | Increased propranolol levels | Monitor for bradycardia; may need dose reduction |
| CYP1A2 inhibitors (fluvoxamine, ciprofloxacin) | Increased propranolol levels | Monitor; dose adjustment may be needed |
| NSAIDs | Reduced antihypertensive effect | Monitor blood pressure |
| Epinephrine | Unopposed alpha stimulation, severe hypertension | Use with caution; may need glucagon for anaphylaxis |

### Moderate Interactions
- Digoxin — additive bradycardia
- Antiarrhythmics (amiodarone, lidocaine) — increased plasma levels of both
- Warfarin — modest increase in warfarin levels
- Theophylline — reduced clearance of theophylline
- Alcohol — may increase propranolol levels

## 10. Monitoring Parameters

### Baseline (Before Starting)
- Heart rate and blood pressure
- 12-lead ECG (assess for pre-existing conduction disease)
- Pulmonary function if history of reactive airway disease
- Blood glucose (if diabetic)
- Hepatic function (if hepatic impairment suspected)

### Ongoing Monitoring
- **Heart rate:** At every visit; target resting HR 55-75 bpm
- **Blood pressure:** At every visit; avoid SBP < 90 mmHg
- **Symptoms:** Fatigue, dizziness, cold extremities, mood changes
- **PVC-specific:** Repeat Holter at 4-8 weeks to assess PVC burden reduction
- **LV function:** Echocardiogram at 6 months if initial PVC burden was high

## 11. Patient Education Points

### Taking the Medication
- Take at the same times each day for consistent blood levels
- Immediate-release: typically with meals (food increases absorption consistency)
- Do not crush or chew extended-release capsules
- If a dose is missed, take it as soon as remembered unless close to next dose

### What to Expect
- Heart rate will be lower than usual — this is the intended effect
- May feel more tired for the first 1-2 weeks; this usually improves
- Full benefit for PVC reduction may take 2-4 weeks
- Cold hands and feet are common but usually tolerable

### Warning Signs (Contact Doctor)
- Resting heart rate consistently below 50 bpm
- Dizziness or lightheadedness when standing up
- Significant weight gain (> 2 kg in one week)
- Wheezing or difficulty breathing
- Unusual fatigue or depression
- Worsening of PVC symptoms despite medication

### Critical Safety
- **Never stop propranolol suddenly** — always taper under medical supervision
- Abrupt withdrawal can cause dangerous rebound effects (rapid heart rate, elevated blood pressure, chest pain)
- Carry medical identification noting beta-blocker use
- Inform all healthcare providers and dentists about this medication
- Avoid excessive alcohol (potentiates hypotension)

## 12. Special Populations

### Elderly
- Start at lower doses (10 mg BID)
- Greater sensitivity to bradycardia and hypotension
- Fall risk increases with postural hypotension
- More likely to have renal/hepatic impairment affecting drug clearance

### Pregnancy (Category C)
- Crosses placenta; may cause fetal bradycardia, hypoglycemia
- Use only when benefit clearly outweighs risk
- If used, monitor neonatal heart rate and glucose

### Hepatic Impairment
- Reduced first-pass metabolism increases bioavailability
- Start at lower doses; increase cautiously
- Consider longer dosing intervals

### Renal Impairment
- No dose adjustment typically needed (< 1% excreted unchanged)
- Dialysis does not significantly remove propranolol
