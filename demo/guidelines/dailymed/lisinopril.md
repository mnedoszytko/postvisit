# Lisinopril

## Drug Name and Class

**Generic Name:** Lisinopril
**Brand Names:** Zestril, Prinivil
**Drug Class:** Angiotensin-converting enzyme (ACE) inhibitor
**Routes:** Oral (tablets)

## Indications

Lisinopril is indicated for:

- **Hypertension** — in adults and pediatric patients aged 6 years and older. May be used alone or concomitantly with other antihypertensive agents.
- **Heart failure** — as adjunctive therapy with diuretics and digitalis to reduce symptoms and improve survival.
- **Acute myocardial infarction** — within 24 hours in hemodynamically stable patients to reduce mortality.

## Dosage and Administration

| Indication | Initial Dose | Target/Maintenance | Maximum |
|---|---|---|---|
| Hypertension (adults) | 10 mg once daily | 20-40 mg once daily | 80 mg/day |
| Hypertension (on diuretics) | 5 mg once daily | Titrate to response | 80 mg/day |
| Hypertension (pediatric 6+) | 0.07 mg/kg once daily | Titrate per response | 5 mg initial |
| Heart failure | 5 mg once daily | Titrate upward as tolerated | 40 mg/day |
| Acute MI | 5 mg within 24h of onset | 10 mg once daily after 48h | 10 mg/day |

### Renal Dose Adjustments
| CrCl (mL/min) | Initial Dose |
|---|---|
| > 30 | Standard dosing |
| 10-30 | 5 mg (half normal dose) |
| < 10 (including dialysis) | 2.5 mg |

## Warnings and Precautions

- **Fetal toxicity (BOXED WARNING):** Discontinue as soon as pregnancy is detected. ACE inhibitors can cause fetal injury and death when used during the second and third trimesters. Oligohydramnios, neonatal renal failure, hypotension, and death have been reported.
- **Angioedema:** Can occur at any time during treatment, including after years of therapy. Involves face, extremities, lips, tongue, glottis, and/or larynx. Discontinue immediately and provide appropriate emergency treatment. Higher incidence in Black patients.
- **Hypotension:** Especially in volume-depleted or salt-depleted patients, heart failure patients, and those on high-dose diuretics. Correct volume/salt depletion before starting therapy.
- **Hyperkalemia:** Risk factors include renal insufficiency, diabetes, potassium-sparing diuretics, and potassium supplements. Monitor serum potassium regularly.
- **Renal impairment:** Acute renal failure possible, particularly in patients with bilateral renal artery stenosis, heart failure, or volume depletion. Monitor renal function periodically.
- **Hepatic failure:** Rarely, ACE inhibitors cause cholestatic jaundice progressing to fulminant hepatic necrosis. Discontinue if jaundice or marked hepatic enzyme elevation develops.
- **Cough:** Persistent, nonproductive cough occurs in up to 10% of patients. Resolves after discontinuation.

## Adverse Reactions

**Common (hypertension):** Headache (5.7%), dizziness (5.4%), cough (3.5%), fatigue, diarrhea, nausea, upper respiratory symptoms.

**Common (heart failure):** Hypotension (3.8%), chest pain (3.4%), dizziness, diarrhea.

**Laboratory abnormalities:** Hyperkalemia (2.2-4.8%), elevated creatinine/BUN, small decreases in hemoglobin and hematocrit, rarely elevated liver enzymes/bilirubin.

**Serious but rare:** Angioedema, anaphylactoid reactions, agranulocytosis, neutropenia, bone marrow depression, hepatic failure, pancreatitis.

## Drug Interactions

| Interacting Drug | Effect |
|---|---|
| Diuretics | Excessive blood pressure reduction — reduce diuretic dose or start lisinopril at lower dose |
| NSAIDs (including COX-2 inhibitors) | Reduced antihypertensive effect; increased renal impairment risk |
| ARBs or Aliskiren (dual RAS blockade) | Increased risk of hyperkalemia, hypotension, and acute kidney injury — avoid |
| Lithium | Increased lithium toxicity — monitor levels closely |
| Potassium-sparing diuretics / K+ supplements | Hyperkalemia risk — monitor potassium |
| mTOR inhibitors (sirolimus, everolimus) | Increased angioedema risk |
| Neprilysin inhibitors (sacubitril) | Increased angioedema risk — do not administer within 36 hours |
| Gold (sodium aurothiomalate) | Nitritoid reactions (flushing, nausea, hypotension) |

## Use in Specific Populations

**Pregnancy:** Contraindicated. Causes fetal and neonatal injury when used in the second and third trimesters including renal failure, hypotension, skull hypoplasia, and death.

**Lactation:** Not recommended. Advise against breastfeeding due to potential for serious adverse effects on the nursing infant.

**Pediatric Patients:** Safety and efficacy established in ages 6-16 years. Not recommended in children under 6 years or with GFR < 30 mL/min/1.73m2.

**Geriatric Patients:** No dosage adjustment required. Monitor renal function closely. Patients 75 years and older had higher discontinuation rates due to renal dysfunction in clinical trials.

**Race:** ACE inhibitors are less effective at reducing blood pressure in Black patients compared to non-Black populations. Black patients also have a higher incidence of angioedema.
