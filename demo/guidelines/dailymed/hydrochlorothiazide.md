# Hydrochlorothiazide

## Drug Name and Class

**Generic Name:** Hydrochlorothiazide (HCTZ)
**Brand Names:** Microzide, HydroDIURIL
**Drug Class:** Thiazide diuretic (benzothiadiazine sulfonamide)
**Routes:** Oral (tablets, capsules)

## Indications

Hydrochlorothiazide is indicated for:

- **Hypertension** — alone or in combination with other antihypertensive agents. First-line antihypertensive per guidelines.
- **Edema** — associated with congestive heart failure, hepatic cirrhosis, corticosteroid and estrogen therapy, and renal dysfunction (nephrotic syndrome, acute glomerulonephritis, chronic renal failure).

May be particularly useful in patients where hyperkalemia is a risk (e.g., those taking ACE inhibitors or ARBs), as thiazides promote potassium excretion.

**Note:** Routine use in otherwise healthy pregnant women is not recommended.

## Dosage and Administration

| Indication | Initial Dose | Usual Dose | Maximum |
|---|---|---|---|
| Hypertension | 12.5-25 mg once daily | 25-50 mg once daily | 50 mg/day |
| Edema | 25-100 mg once daily or in divided doses | Minimum effective dose | 200 mg/day (edema) |

- Administer in the morning to minimize nocturia.
- May take with or without food.
- Antihypertensive effect begins within 2 hours, peaks at 4 hours, lasts 6-12 hours.
- Full antihypertensive effect may take 2-4 weeks.
- Clinically significant hypokalemia is consistently less common at 12.5 mg vs. higher doses.
- Doses exceeding 50 mg/day for hypertension provide minimal additional benefit and increase electrolyte disturbances.

## Warnings and Precautions

- **Electrolyte imbalances:** Monitor serum electrolytes regularly (potassium, sodium, magnesium, calcium, chloride, bicarbonate). Hypokalemia is the most common electrolyte disturbance. May require potassium supplementation or addition of potassium-sparing diuretic.
- **Renal impairment:** Cumulative effects of thiazides may develop in patients with impaired renal function. If progressive renal impairment occurs, withhold or discontinue therapy. Not effective at GFR < 30 mL/min (switch to loop diuretic).
- **Hepatic impairment:** Use with caution. Minor alterations in fluid and electrolyte balance may precipitate hepatic coma in cirrhotic patients.
- **Acute myopia and angle-closure glaucoma:** Idiosyncratic reaction reported (typically within hours to weeks of starting). Symptoms include acute decrease in visual acuity and/or ocular pain. Discontinue immediately if suspected.
- **Diabetes mellitus:** May cause latent diabetes to become manifest. May alter glucose tolerance. Monitor blood glucose.
- **Hyperuricemia:** May elevate serum uric acid levels and precipitate gout in susceptible patients.
- **Hypercalcemia:** Thiazides decrease calcium excretion. May unmask hyperparathyroidism. Discontinue before parathyroid function testing.
- **SLE activation:** Systemic lupus erythematosus exacerbation or activation has been reported.
- **Skin cancer:** HCTZ is associated with an increased risk of non-melanoma skin cancer (basal cell carcinoma, squamous cell carcinoma). Patients should limit sun exposure and undergo regular skin cancer screening.
- **Photosensitivity:** Phototoxic reactions may occur. Advise sun protection.

## Adverse Reactions

**Common:** Dizziness, headache, orthostatic hypotension, nausea, anorexia, gastric irritation, diarrhea, constipation, muscle cramps, weakness, fatigue.

**Electrolyte-related:** Hypokalemia, hyponatremia, hypomagnesemia, hypochloremic alkalosis, hypercalcemia, hyperuricemia, hyperglycemia.

**Serious:** Pancreatitis, jaundice (intrahepatic cholestatic), aplastic anemia, agranulocytosis, leukopenia, thrombocytopenia, necrotizing angiitis, Stevens-Johnson syndrome, toxic epidermal necrolysis, exfoliative dermatitis, respiratory distress (including pneumonitis and pulmonary edema), renal failure.

**Metabolic:** Increased total cholesterol, LDL cholesterol, and triglycerides. May worsen pre-existing dyslipidemia.

## Drug Interactions

| Interacting Drug | Effect |
|---|---|
| Alcohol, barbiturates, narcotics | Potentiated orthostatic hypotension |
| Antidiabetic agents (insulin, oral) | Dose adjustment may be required (hyperglycemia) |
| Other antihypertensives | Additive hypotensive effect |
| Lithium | Decreased lithium clearance — increased toxicity risk. Avoid combination if possible. |
| NSAIDs | Reduced diuretic and antihypertensive effectiveness; increased renal impairment risk |
| Corticosteroids, ACTH | Intensified electrolyte depletion, especially hypokalemia |
| Cholestyramine/colestipol | Reduced HCTZ absorption — give HCTZ 2 hours before or 4-6 hours after |
| Digitalis glycosides | Hypokalemia may increase risk of digitalis toxicity |
| Carbamazepine | Increased risk of hyponatremia |
| Calcium salts | Increased hypercalcemia risk |

## Use in Specific Populations

**Pregnancy:** Thiazides cross the placental barrier. Use during pregnancy only if clearly necessary. May cause fetal or neonatal jaundice, thrombocytopenia, and possibly other adverse reactions. Not recommended for routine use in healthy pregnant women.

**Lactation:** Appears in breast milk. May suppress lactation. Weigh benefits of breastfeeding against potential adverse effects.

**Pediatric Patients:** Safety and efficacy not established in clinical trials. Not FDA-approved for pediatric use.

**Geriatric Patients (>= 65 years):** Start at lower dose (12.5 mg daily). Greater sensitivity to hypotensive and electrolyte effects. Monitor electrolytes and renal function more frequently.

**Renal Impairment:** Ineffective as monotherapy when GFR < 30 mL/min. Cumulative effects may develop. Monitor renal function. May worsen azotemia.

**Hepatic Impairment:** Use with caution. Electrolyte changes may precipitate hepatic encephalopathy and coma in cirrhotic patients.
