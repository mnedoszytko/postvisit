# Propranolol Hydrochloride

## Drug Name and Class

**Generic Name:** Propranolol Hydrochloride
**Drug Class:** Non-selective beta-adrenergic receptor blocking agent (beta-blocker)
**Routes:** Oral (tablets)

## Indications

Propranolol is indicated for the management of:

- **Hypertension** — to lower blood pressure (not appropriate for hypertensive emergencies)
- **Angina pectoris** due to coronary atherosclerosis
- **Atrial fibrillation** — to control ventricular rate
- **Myocardial infarction** — to reduce cardiovascular mortality in clinically stable post-MI patients
- **Migraine prophylaxis** — to reduce frequency and severity of migraine headaches
- **Essential tremor** — familial or hereditary tremor
- **Hypertrophic subaortic stenosis**
- **Pheochromocytoma** — adjunctive therapy (after alpha-blockade)

**Off-label but relevant:** Commonly used for premature ventricular complexes (PVCs) and symptomatic arrhythmia suppression.

## Dosage and Administration

| Indication | Initial Dose | Maintenance/Target | Max Daily |
|---|---|---|---|
| Hypertension | 40 mg twice daily | 120-240 mg/day | 640 mg |
| Angina | 80-320 mg/day in divided doses | Titrate to response | 320 mg |
| Atrial fibrillation | 10-30 mg TID-QID | Titrate to rate control | 120 mg |
| Post-MI | 40 mg TID | 180-240 mg/day in divided doses | 240 mg |
| Migraine prophylaxis | 80 mg/day in divided doses | 160-240 mg/day | 240 mg |
| Essential tremor | 40 mg twice daily | 120 mg/day usual effective dose | 320 mg |

Administer consistently with or without food. Peak plasma concentrations occur 1-4 hours after oral dose. Only approximately 25% reaches systemic circulation due to extensive first-pass hepatic metabolism. Half-life: 3-6 hours.

## Warnings and Precautions

- **Do not discontinue abruptly.** Gradual dose reduction over at least a few weeks is required. Abrupt withdrawal may exacerbate angina pectoris and precipitate myocardial infarction or ventricular arrhythmias.
- **Cardiac failure:** Beta-blockers may precipitate heart failure in susceptible patients. Use with caution; if heart failure develops, discontinuation should be considered.
- **Bronchospastic disease:** Administer with extreme caution in patients with bronchospasm (asthma, COPD). Non-selective beta-blockade may provoke life-threatening bronchospasm.
- **Masked hypoglycemia:** May mask tachycardia and other adrenergic symptoms of hypoglycemia in diabetic patients. Blood glucose monitoring is essential.
- **Masked thyrotoxicosis:** May mask clinical signs of hyperthyroidism. Abrupt withdrawal may precipitate thyroid storm.
- **Wolff-Parkinson-White syndrome:** May cause paradoxical increases in heart rate.
- **Major surgery:** Gradual withdrawal before elective surgery is controversial; however, impaired cardiac response to reflex stimuli may augment surgical risks.

## Adverse Reactions

**Cardiovascular:** Bradycardia, congestive heart failure, hypotension, intensification of AV block, arterial insufficiency (Raynaud's type).

**Central Nervous System:** Fatigue, lethargy, vivid dreams, depression, insomnia, lassitude, weakness, dizziness, paresthesias, visual disturbances, hallucinations.

**Gastrointestinal:** Nausea, vomiting, diarrhea, constipation, epigastric distress, abdominal cramping.

**Respiratory:** Bronchospasm, dyspnea.

**Dermatologic:** Stevens-Johnson syndrome, toxic epidermal necrolysis, alopecia, psoriasiform rash.

**Genitourinary:** Male impotence, Peyronie's disease.

**Allergic:** Anaphylactoid/anaphylactic reactions, erythematous rash, pharyngitis, agranulocytosis.

## Drug Interactions

| Interacting Drug | Effect |
|---|---|
| CYP2D6/1A2/2C19 inhibitors | Increased propranolol levels |
| Calcium channel blockers | Risk of bradycardia and heart block |
| ACE inhibitors | May cause hypotension |
| NSAIDs | Blunt antihypertensive effects |
| Warfarin | Increased prothrombin time |
| Digitalis glycosides | Additive AV conduction slowing |
| Catecholamine-depleting drugs (reserpine) | Excessive reduction of sympathetic activity |
| Haloperidol | Hypotension, cardiac arrest |
| Aluminum hydroxide gel | Reduced GI absorption |
| Alcohol | Increased propranolol levels |

## Use in Specific Populations

**Pregnancy (Category C):** Animal studies showed embryotoxicity and neonatal toxicity at high doses. Neonates born to mothers on propranolol may exhibit bradycardia, hypoglycemia, and respiratory depression. Use only when benefits clearly justify fetal risks. Monitor neonates closely after delivery.

**Lactation:** Excreted in human milk. Exercise caution when administering to nursing women.

**Geriatric Patients:** Clearance decreases with aging. Half-life extends to approximately 11 hours (vs. 5 hours in younger adults). Start with lower doses and titrate slowly.

**Renal Insufficiency:** Peak concentrations 2-3 fold higher in chronic renal failure. Clearance is reduced. Not significantly removed by dialysis.

**Hepatic Insufficiency:** Extensive hepatic metabolism means cirrhosis increases steady-state unbound concentrations approximately 3-fold. Half-life extends to ~11 hours. Use reduced doses.
