# Dapagliflozin

## Drug Name and Class

**Generic Name:** Dapagliflozin
**Brand Name:** Farxiga
**Drug Class:** Sodium-glucose co-transporter 2 (SGLT2) inhibitor
**Routes:** Oral (tablets)

## Indications

Dapagliflozin is indicated for:

- **Heart failure** — to reduce the risk of cardiovascular death and hospitalization for heart failure in adults with heart failure (HFrEF and HFpEF).
- **Chronic kidney disease** — to reduce the risk of sustained eGFR decline, end-stage kidney disease, cardiovascular death, and hospitalization for heart failure.
- **Type 2 diabetes mellitus** — to reduce the risk of hospitalization for heart failure in adults with established cardiovascular disease or multiple cardiovascular risk factors; as adjunct to diet and exercise to improve glycemic control.
- **Not recommended** for type 1 diabetes.
- For glycemic improvement, not recommended with eGFR < 45 mL/min/1.73m2 (glycemic efficacy depends on renal function).

## Dosage and Administration

| Indication | Dose | Notes |
|---|---|---|
| Heart failure | 10 mg once daily | Any LVEF |
| Chronic kidney disease | 10 mg once daily | Continue unless dialysis initiated |
| Type 2 diabetes (glycemic control) | Start 5 mg daily, may increase to 10 mg | Not for eGFR < 45 |
| Type 2 diabetes (CV risk reduction) | 10 mg once daily | With established CVD or risk factors |

- Assess renal function and volume status before initiation.
- Correct volume depletion before starting.
- May be taken with or without food.
- Withhold for at least 3 days before scheduled major surgery if possible.

## Warnings and Precautions

- **Ketoacidosis:** Cases of diabetic ketoacidosis (DKA) have been reported, including in patients with type 2 diabetes. May present with only moderately elevated blood glucose. Assess for ketoacidosis if signs/symptoms develop (nausea, vomiting, abdominal pain, malaise, dyspnea). Withhold dapagliflozin in clinical situations known to predispose to ketoacidosis (prolonged fasting, acute illness, surgery).
- **Volume depletion:** SGLT2 inhibitors cause intravascular volume contraction. Symptomatic hypotension may occur, especially in patients with renal impairment, elderly, those on diuretics, or with low systolic BP. Correct volume depletion before initiation. Monitor for signs/symptoms.
- **Urosepsis and pyelonephritis:** Serious urinary tract infections requiring hospitalization have been reported. Evaluate and treat promptly.
- **Hypoglycemia:** When used with insulin or insulin secretagogues (sulfonylureas), risk of hypoglycemia is increased. Consider lower doses of insulin or secretagogue to reduce risk.
- **Necrotizing fasciitis of the perineum (Fournier's gangrene):** Rare but serious and life-threatening. If suspected, discontinue and initiate broad-spectrum antibiotics and surgical debridement immediately.
- **Genital mycotic infections:** SGLT2 inhibitors increase risk. More common in women. Patients with history of genital mycotic infections are at higher risk. Treat appropriately.

## Adverse Reactions

**Most common (>= 5%):**
Female genital mycotic infections, nasopharyngitis, urinary tract infections, back pain, increased urination (polyuria, pollakiuria, nocturia).

**Heart failure trials:** Volume depletion events, renal adverse events (mostly transient creatinine increases).

**Laboratory changes:**
- Increased hematocrit (consistent with hemoconcentration)
- Increased serum creatinine (small, reversible)
- Decreased eGFR (initial dip, stabilizes)
- Increased serum phosphate, LDL cholesterol
- Decreased serum uric acid

## Drug Interactions

| Interacting Drug | Effect |
|---|---|
| Insulin / insulin secretagogues | Increased risk of hypoglycemia — consider dose reduction |
| Diuretics | Potentiated volume depletion and hypotension |
| Lithium | May decrease lithium levels — monitor |
| Positive pressure urine glucose tests | May cause false negative results (drug inhibits renal glucose reabsorption) |
| 1,5-anhydroglucitol (1,5-AG) assay | Unreliable for glycemic monitoring — do not use |

## Use in Specific Populations

**Pregnancy:** Limited data. Avoid during second and third trimesters based on animal studies showing adverse renal effects. SGLT2 inhibitors affect renal development. Discontinue when pregnancy is recognized.

**Lactation:** No human data. Not recommended during breastfeeding based on potential risk to nursing infant (animal data showed presence in milk).

**Pediatric Patients:** Approved for ages 10 years and older for type 2 diabetes. Safety and efficacy not established for CKD or HF in pediatric patients.

**Geriatric Patients:** Greater incidence of volume depletion-related adverse reactions in patients >= 65 years. Monitor more closely. No dose adjustment needed.

**Renal Impairment:**
- Heart failure and CKD: No eGFR limitation for initiation.
- Type 2 diabetes (glycemic control): Not recommended if eGFR < 45 mL/min/1.73m2 (reduced efficacy for glucose lowering, though cardiorenal benefits persist).
- Type 2 diabetes (CV risk reduction): No eGFR limitation.
- Dialysis: Not recommended.

**Hepatic Impairment:** No dose adjustment for mild-to-moderate impairment. Limited data in severe impairment.
