# Amlodipine Besylate

## Drug Name and Class

**Generic Name:** Amlodipine Besylate
**Brand Name:** Norvasc
**Drug Class:** Dihydropyridine calcium channel blocker (CCB)
**Routes:** Oral (tablets)

## Indications

Amlodipine is indicated for:

- **Hypertension** — to lower blood pressure and reduce the risk of fatal and nonfatal cardiovascular events (primarily strokes and myocardial infarction). May be used alone or in combination with other antihypertensive agents.
- **Coronary artery disease:**
  - **Chronic stable angina** — reduces frequency of anginal episodes and need for sublingual nitroglycerin
  - **Vasospastic (Prinzmetal's) angina** — confirmed or suspected
  - **Angiographically documented CAD** — reduces risk of hospitalization for angina and coronary revascularization in patients without heart failure or LVEF < 40%

## Dosage and Administration

| Population | Starting Dose | Maximum Dose | Notes |
|---|---|---|---|
| Adults (hypertension) | 5 mg once daily | 10 mg once daily | Titrate over 7-14 days |
| Adults (angina) | 5-10 mg once daily | 10 mg once daily | Most patients require 10 mg |
| Elderly patients (>= 65) | 2.5 mg once daily | 10 mg once daily | Decreased clearance |
| Hepatic impairment | 2.5 mg once daily | 10 mg once daily | Slow titration |
| Pediatric (6-17 years) | 2.5 mg once daily | 5 mg once daily | Doses >5 mg not studied |
| Small/fragile patients | 2.5 mg once daily | 10 mg once daily | Lower starting dose |

Amlodipine may be taken with or without food. It has a long half-life (30-50 hours), allowing once-daily dosing. Steady-state plasma levels are reached after 7-8 days of consecutive dosing.

## Warnings and Precautions

- **Hypotension:** Symptomatic hypotension is possible, particularly in patients with severe aortic stenosis. Patients are at risk for acute cardiovascular events during dose initiation or increase.
- **Worsening angina or acute MI:** Increased frequency, duration, or severity of angina or acute myocardial infarction may develop when initiating amlodipine or increasing dose, particularly in patients with severe obstructive coronary artery disease.
- **Hepatic impairment:** Amlodipine is extensively metabolized by the liver. Slow titration is required in patients with severe hepatic impairment. Plasma half-life is prolonged.
- **Heart failure:** Use with caution. In the PRAISE-2 trial, amlodipine did not increase morbidity/mortality in NYHA III-IV patients, but calcium channel blockers should be used cautiously in heart failure patients.

## Adverse Reactions

**Most common (>= 5%):**
Edema (dose-dependent — 1.8% at 2.5 mg, 3.0% at 5 mg, 10.8% at 10 mg), fatigue, dizziness, flushing, palpitations.

**Common (1-5%):**
Nausea, abdominal pain, somnolence, headache, muscle cramps.

**Less common (<1%):**
Dyspnea, asthenia, paresthesia, rash, pruritus, urinary frequency, visual disturbance, gynecomastia, weight gain/loss, dry mouth.

**Gender differences:** Women experience higher incidence of edema (14.6% vs. 5.6%) and flushing (4.5% vs. 1.5%) compared to men.

**Postmarketing:** Jaundice, hepatitis, gynecomastia, extrapyramidal syndrome, leukocytopenia, thrombocytopenia, peripheral neuropathy.

## Drug Interactions

| Interacting Drug | Effect |
|---|---|
| CYP3A4 inhibitors (ketoconazole, itraconazole, ritonavir, diltiazem, clarithromycin) | Increased amlodipine exposure — monitor for hypotension and edema |
| CYP3A4 inducers (rifampin, St. John's wort) | Decreased amlodipine levels — may reduce efficacy |
| Simvastatin | Limit simvastatin to 20 mg/day with concurrent amlodipine (increased myopathy risk) |
| Cyclosporine | Increased cyclosporine levels — monitor closely |
| Tacrolimus | Increased tacrolimus levels — monitor and adjust |
| Sildenafil | Additive blood pressure reduction |
| Beta-blockers | Generally safe combination; additive blood pressure lowering |

## Use in Specific Populations

**Pregnancy:** Limited human data. Animal studies at ~10x human doses showed delayed parturition and prolonged labor. Use during pregnancy only if potential benefit justifies potential risk.

**Lactation:** Amlodipine is present in human breast milk (estimated infant dose 4.2% of maternal dose). No adverse effects observed in limited lactation data. Consider developmental benefits of breastfeeding alongside maternal clinical need.

**Pediatric Patients:** Safety and efficacy established in ages 6-17 years for hypertension. Doses above 5 mg have not been studied. Not studied in children under 6 years.

**Geriatric Patients:** Clearance is decreased and AUC is increased by approximately 40-60% in elderly patients. Start at 2.5 mg daily. Time to peak plasma concentration is unchanged.

**Hepatic Impairment:** Half-life is prolonged; AUC increases. Start at 2.5 mg daily with gradual titration. Amlodipine is extensively metabolized by the liver.

**Renal Impairment:** No dose adjustment necessary. Amlodipine is not dialyzable. Pharmacokinetics are not significantly altered in renal failure.
