# Carvedilol

## Drug Name and Class

**Generic Name:** Carvedilol
**Brand Name:** Coreg
**Drug Class:** Non-selective beta-adrenergic blocker with alpha1-blocking activity
**Routes:** Oral (tablets, extended-release capsules)

## Indications

Carvedilol is indicated for:

- **Chronic heart failure** — mild-to-severe, of ischemic or cardiomyopathic origin, usually in addition to diuretics, ACE inhibitors, and digitalis. Reduces mortality and hospitalization.
- **Left ventricular dysfunction following myocardial infarction** — in clinically stable post-MI patients with LVEF <= 40%, with or without symptomatic heart failure. Reduces cardiovascular mortality.
- **Hypertension** — to lower blood pressure, alone or with other antihypertensive agents.

## Dosage and Administration

**Take with food** to slow absorption and reduce risk of orthostatic hypotension.

| Indication | Initial Dose | Titration | Target Dose |
|---|---|---|---|
| Heart failure | 3.125 mg twice daily | Double dose every 2+ weeks as tolerated | 25 mg BID (<85 kg) or 50 mg BID (>85 kg) |
| Post-MI (LVEF <= 40%) | 6.25 mg twice daily | Increase to 12.5 mg BID after 3-10 days, then to 25 mg BID | 25 mg twice daily |
| Hypertension | 6.25 mg twice daily | Increase to 12.5 then 25 mg BID at 1-2 week intervals | 25 mg twice daily |

Maximum total daily dose: 50 mg for most patients. Heart failure patients >85 kg may receive up to 50 mg twice daily.

**Heart failure titration:** Standing systolic BP should be measured ~1 hour after dosing. If pulse rate drops below 55 bpm, reduce dose. If worsening HF or fluid retention, increase diuretics first.

## Warnings and Precautions

- **Do not discontinue abruptly.** Particularly in patients with coronary artery disease. Taper over 1-2 weeks. Exacerbation of angina, MI, and ventricular arrhythmias may occur with sudden withdrawal.
- **Bradycardia:** If heart rate drops below 55 bpm, reduce dose.
- **Hypotension and postural hypotension:** Most common during initial therapy and dose titration. Reduce dose if symptomatic. Take with food.
- **Heart failure / fluid retention:** Worsening heart failure or fluid retention may occur during up-titration. Manage with diuretic adjustment before reducing carvedilol dose.
- **Bronchospastic disease:** Use with caution in patients with bronchospasm. Non-selective beta-blockade may provoke bronchospasm. Use lowest effective dose and advise patients to report any respiratory difficulty.
- **Diabetes mellitus:** Beta-blockers may mask tachycardia associated with hypoglycemia. Monitor blood glucose regularly. May worsen hyperglycemia in heart failure patients.
- **Peripheral vascular disease:** May aggravate symptoms of arterial insufficiency.
- **Thyrotoxicosis:** May mask clinical signs of hyperthyroidism.
- **Pheochromocytoma:** Establish alpha-blockade before initiating beta-blockade.
- **Anesthesia/surgery:** Notify anesthesiologist of beta-blocker use. Risk of prolonged hypotension and difficulty restoring heart rate.

## Adverse Reactions

**Heart failure trials — common (>5%):**
Dizziness (32%), fatigue (24%), hypotension (14%), diarrhea (12%), hyperglycemia (12%), asthenia (11%), bradycardia (10%), weight increase (10%), edema (generalized, dependent, peripheral), BUN increased.

**Hypertension trials — common (>5%):**
Dizziness (6%), fatigue, diarrhea.

**Post-MI trials — common (>5%):**
Fatigue, hypotension, dizziness.

**Postmarketing (rare/serious):** Aplastic anemia, hypersensitivity reactions, Stevens-Johnson syndrome, toxic epidermal necrolysis, erythema multiforme, alopecia, interstitial pneumonitis.

## Drug Interactions

| Interacting Drug | Effect |
|---|---|
| CYP2D6 inhibitors (fluoxetine, paroxetine, quinidine) | Increased R(+)-carvedilol levels — enhanced beta-blocking |
| Catecholamine-depleting agents (reserpine, MAO inhibitors) | Enhanced hypotension and/or severe bradycardia |
| Clonidine | Enhanced bradycardia; if discontinuing both, stop clonidine several days after carvedilol |
| Cyclosporine | Increased cyclosporine levels — monitor and adjust |
| Digoxin | Increased digoxin levels (~15%) — monitor digoxin levels |
| Amiodarone | Enhanced beta-blocking effects; risk of severe bradycardia |
| Calcium channel blockers (diltiazem, verapamil) | Conduction disturbances, severe bradycardia — ECG and BP monitoring required |
| Insulin and oral hypoglycemics | Enhanced blood glucose-lowering effect; masked hypoglycemia symptoms |
| Rifampin | Reduced carvedilol plasma levels (~70%) |

## Use in Specific Populations

**Pregnancy:** Insufficient human data. Animal studies showed fetal toxicity at high doses. Use only if potential benefit justifies fetal risk.

**Lactation:** Carvedilol appears in rat breast milk. Unknown if excreted in human milk. Consider benefits of breastfeeding vs. risk to infant.

**Pediatric Patients:** Effectiveness has not been established in patients under 18 years.

**Geriatric Patients:** Plasma levels approximately 50% higher in elderly compared to younger patients. Similar safety and efficacy profiles observed, but start at lowest dose and titrate carefully.

**Hepatic Impairment:** Contraindicated in patients with clinically manifest hepatic impairment. Carvedilol undergoes extensive hepatic metabolism.

**Renal Impairment:** Use with caution. Deterioration of renal function has been reported. Monitor renal function during dose titration; discontinue or reduce dose if worsening occurs.
