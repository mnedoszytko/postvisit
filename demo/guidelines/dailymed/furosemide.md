# Furosemide

## Drug Name and Class

**Generic Name:** Furosemide
**Brand Name:** Lasix
**Drug Class:** Loop diuretic (sulfonamide-type)
**Routes:** Oral (tablets), intravenous, intramuscular

## Indications

Furosemide is indicated for the treatment of:

- **Edema associated with congestive heart failure** — first-line diuretic for volume overload in HF
- **Edema associated with hepatic cirrhosis** (ascites)
- **Edema associated with renal disease** including nephrotic syndrome
- **Hypertension** — alone or combined with other antihypertensive agents

## Dosage and Administration

### Adults — Edema
| Setting | Initial Dose | Titration | Maximum |
|---|---|---|---|
| Oral | 20-80 mg single dose | Increase by 20-40 mg every 6-8 hours | 600 mg/day |
| IV/IM | 20-40 mg single dose | Increase by 20 mg every 2 hours | As needed |

Prompt diuresis typically follows administration. Maintenance: once or twice daily dosing at the minimum effective dose.

### Adults — Hypertension
Usual initial dose: 80 mg/day, typically 40 mg twice daily. Adjust based on blood pressure response.

### Pediatric Patients
Initial dose: 2 mg/kg body weight. May increase by 1-2 mg/kg at 6-8 hour intervals. Do not exceed 6 mg/kg/dose.

## Warnings and Precautions

- **Profound diuresis:** May cause severe water and electrolyte depletion. Careful medical supervision required. Dose should be adjusted to patient needs.
- **Hepatic coma:** In patients with hepatic cirrhosis, rapid electrolyte changes may precipitate hepatic encephalopathy. Initiate therapy in hospital.
- **Ototoxicity:** Tinnitus and reversible or irreversible hearing loss reported, especially with rapid IV injection, severe renal impairment, high doses, or concurrent aminoglycoside use. IV injection rate should not exceed 4 mg/min.
- **Electrolyte depletion:** Monitor for hypokalemia, hyponatremia, hypochloremia, hypomagnesemia, and hypocalcemia. Potassium supplementation or potassium-sparing diuretic may be needed.
- **Hyperuricemia:** May increase uric acid levels; can precipitate gout.
- **Hyperglycemia:** Altered glucose tolerance and diabetes precipitation have been reported.
- **Photosensitivity:** Patients should be advised to avoid excessive sun exposure.

## Adverse Reactions

**Serious:** Hepatic encephalopathy, pancreatitis, aplastic anemia, agranulocytosis, thrombocytopenia, anaphylactic reactions, Stevens-Johnson syndrome, toxic epidermal necrolysis, interstitial nephritis.

**Common:** Tinnitus, hearing loss (usually reversible), dizziness, orthostatic hypotension, nausea, vomiting, constipation, diarrhea, cramping, hyperglycemia, hyperuricemia, hypokalemia.

**Metabolic:** Hyponatremia, hypochloremic alkalosis, hypomagnesemia, hypocalcemia, increased serum cholesterol and triglycerides.

## Drug Interactions

| Interacting Drug | Effect |
|---|---|
| Aminoglycoside antibiotics | Increased ototoxicity — avoid concurrent use |
| Ethacrynic acid | Additive ototoxicity — do not combine |
| Lithium | Increased lithium toxicity — avoid unless closely monitored |
| NSAIDs / Indomethacin | Reduced diuretic effectiveness and natriuresis |
| Cisplatin | Increased nephrotoxicity — avoid |
| Sucralfate | Reduced furosemide absorption — give 2 hours apart |
| Corticosteroids / ACTH | Enhanced potassium depletion |
| Antihypertensives | Potentiated hypotensive effects |
| Tubocurarine | Potentiated neuromuscular blockade |
| High-dose salicylates | CNS toxicity risk at lower salicylate levels |
| Thyroid hormones | High-dose furosemide may inhibit thyroid hormone protein binding |

## Use in Specific Populations

**Pregnancy:** Animal studies showed maternal deaths and abortions at high doses. No adequate controlled human studies. Use only when potential benefits justify fetal risks. Furosemide crosses the placental barrier.

**Lactation:** Appears in breast milk and may inhibit lactation. Exercise caution when administering to nursing mothers.

**Geriatric Patients:** Start at lower end of dosing range. Decreased renal clearance and blunted initial diuretic response common. Careful monitoring of electrolytes and renal function required.

**Pediatric Patients:** In premature infants and children under 4 years receiving chronic therapy, monitor for nephrocalcinosis and renal calculi (perform periodic renal ultrasound). Prolonged use in premature neonates may increase risk of persistent patent ductus arteriosus.

**Renal Impairment:** Higher doses may be required. Cumulative effects may develop. Monitor renal function closely. Oliguria develops in azotemic patients — discontinue if renal function worsens.

**Hepatic Impairment:** Use with extreme caution in hepatic cirrhosis. Sudden electrolyte changes may precipitate hepatic encephalopathy and coma.
