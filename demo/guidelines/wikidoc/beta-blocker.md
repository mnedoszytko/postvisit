# Beta-Blockers

## Overview

Beta-blockers are medications that block the effects of endogenous catecholamines (epinephrine and norepinephrine) at beta-adrenergic receptors, reducing the sympathetic "fight or flight" response. First developed with propranolol, they revolutionized cardiovascular medicine. While historically used as first-line hypertension therapy, their role has been downgraded in many guidelines due to inferior performance compared to other agents (particularly in elderly patients) and associations with increased type 2 diabetes risk.

## Mechanism of Action

Beta-blockers competitively inhibit catecholamine binding at beta-adrenergic receptors, producing:
- Decreased heart rate (negative chronotropy)
- Decreased contractility (negative inotropy)
- Decreased AV conduction velocity (negative dromotropy)
- Decreased renin secretion from juxtaglomerular cells
- Decreased aqueous humor production (relevant for glaucoma)

## Classification

**Three beta receptor subtypes:**
- **Beta-1**: Primarily in heart and kidneys
- **Beta-2**: Primarily in lungs, GI tract, liver, vascular and skeletal muscle
- **Beta-3**: In fat cells

### Drug Categories

| Category | Examples | Key Feature |
|----------|----------|-------------|
| Non-selective (beta-1 + beta-2) | Propranolol, nadolol, timolol, sotalol | Block both receptor subtypes |
| Beta-1 selective (cardioselective) | Atenolol, metoprolol, bisoprolol, esmolol | Preferential cardiac blockade |
| Mixed alpha-1/beta antagonists | Labetalol, carvedilol | Added vasodilation via alpha blockade |
| ISA agents | Pindolol, oxprenolol | Partial agonist activity at rest |

**Note:** Beta-1 selectivity is dose-dependent and diminishes at higher doses.

## Indications

**Primary cardiovascular uses:**
- Cardiac arrhythmias (rate control, PVC suppression)
- Post-myocardial infarction cardioprotection
- Heart failure (bisoprolol, carvedilol, metoprolol succinate only)
- Angina pectoris
- Hypertension (second-line unless concurrent indication)

**Other indications:**
- Migraine prophylaxis (propranolol)
- Essential tremor (propranolol)
- Hyperthyroidism symptom control
- Portal hypertension / variceal bleeding prevention (propranolol, nadolol)
- Performance anxiety (propranolol)
- Glaucoma (timolol, betaxolol — topical)
- Pheochromocytoma (after alpha-blockade)

## Heart Failure Paradigm

Specific beta-blockers are now standard GDMT for HFrEF despite initial negative inotropic effects. Only three agents have mortality benefit evidence:
- **Bisoprolol** (CIBIS-II trial)
- **Carvedilol** (COPERNICUS trial)
- **Metoprolol succinate** (MERIT-HF trial)

Beta-blockers reduce absolute mortality by 4.5% over 13 months in heart failure patients. They improve ejection fraction over time despite initial reduction.

## Adverse Effects

- **Cardiovascular**: Bradycardia, hypotension, heart block, worsening acute HF
- **Respiratory**: Bronchospasm (especially non-selective agents — avoid in asthma)
- **Metabolic**: Impaired glucose metabolism, dyslipidemia, increased diabetes risk
- **CNS**: Fatigue, dizziness, depression, insomnia, hallucinations (more common with lipophilic agents like propranolol)
- **Sexual**: Erectile dysfunction
- **Peripheral**: Cold extremities, Raynaud's exacerbation
- **Withdrawal**: Rebound tachycardia and hypertension if discontinued abruptly — always taper

## Contraindications

- Severe bradycardia or heart block (second/third degree without pacemaker)
- Decompensated heart failure (acute)
- Severe asthma or reactive airway disease (non-selective agents)
- Pheochromocytoma (without prior alpha-blockade)
- Cocaine or amphetamine overdose (risk of unopposed alpha stimulation causing severe hypertension)

## Drug Interactions

- Calcium channel blockers (verapamil/diltiazem): Additive bradycardia and heart block risk
- Digoxin: Enhanced AV block
- Insulin/sulfonylureas: Mask hypoglycemia symptoms (tremor, tachycardia)
- Clonidine: Severe rebound hypertension if clonidine withdrawn while on beta-blocker
- CYP2D6 inhibitors: Increase levels of metoprolol, propranolol

## Agent-Specific Notes

- **Propranolol**: Lipophilic, short-acting, broad indications (tremor, migraine, portal HTN). More CNS side effects.
- **Metoprolol**: Available as tartrate (twice daily) and succinate (extended-release, once daily — HF-approved formulation).
- **Carvedilol**: Mixed alpha/beta blockade. Vasodilatory properties. HF-approved.
- **Atenolol**: Hydrophilic, fewer CNS effects, renal excretion. Less effective for hypertension per LIFE trial.
- **Sotalol**: Additional Class III antiarrhythmic properties (K+ channel blockade). QT prolongation risk.
- **Esmolol**: Ultra-short-acting IV agent for acute rate control.
- **Labetalol**: Mixed alpha/beta antagonist. First-line for hypertensive emergencies in pregnancy.
