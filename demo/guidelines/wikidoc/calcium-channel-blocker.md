# Calcium Channel Blockers

## Overview

Calcium channel blockers (CCBs) are a pharmaceutical class that blocks L-type voltage-gated calcium channels (VGCCs) in cardiac and vascular smooth muscle cells. By preventing calcium influx during cell depolarization, CCBs reduce muscle contraction, leading to vasodilation and decreased cardiac contractility. Their primary therapeutic applications include hypertension, angina pectoris, and certain arrhythmias.

## Mechanism of Action

CCBs block L-type calcium channels, preventing calcium accumulation within cells during stimulation:

- **Vascular smooth muscle**: Reduced calcium leads to vasodilation, decreased peripheral vascular resistance, and lower blood pressure
- **Cardiac muscle**: Decreased calcium availability reduces contractility (negative inotropic effect), heart rate (negative chronotropic effect), and AV conduction velocity (negative dromotropic effect)
- **Net hemodynamic effect**: Reduced afterload decreases myocardial oxygen demand, providing relief in angina and ischemic heart disease

Unlike beta-blockers, CCBs preserve the heart's responsiveness to sympathetic input, allowing more effective baroreceptor-mediated blood pressure regulation.

## Classification

### Dihydropyridines (DHP)

Identified by the "-dipine" suffix. Selective for vascular smooth muscle with minimal cardiac effects at therapeutic doses.

**Common agents:**
- **Amlodipine** (Norvasc): Long-acting (t1/2 30-50h), once daily, most widely prescribed CCB
- **Nifedipine** (Procardia): Available as IR (avoid — reflex tachycardia) and ER formulations
- **Felodipine** (Plendil)
- **Lercanidipine**, **lacidipine**: Newer, highly vascular-selective

**Characteristics:**
- Potent vasodilation with reflex tachycardia (more pronounced with short-acting agents)
- First-line antihypertensives (especially in Black patients and elderly)
- No significant effect on cardiac conduction
- May worsen proteinuria in nephropathy

### Non-Dihydropyridines (Non-DHP)

**Phenylalkylamines — Verapamil (Calan, Isoptin):**
- Greatest selectivity for myocardium
- Significant negative inotropic, chronotropic, and dromotropic effects
- Minimal reflex tachycardia
- Preferred for angina where tachycardia is undesirable
- Effective for SVT termination and rate control in atrial fibrillation

**Benzothiazepines — Diltiazem (Cardizem, Tiazac):**
- Intermediate between DHP and phenylalkylamine profiles
- Combined vasodilator and cardiac depressant properties
- Less negative inotropy than verapamil
- Commonly used for rate control and angina

## Indications

**Hypertension:**
- DHPs (amlodipine, nifedipine ER) are first-line, especially in Black patients and elderly
- Effective as monotherapy or combined with ACEi/ARB or thiazide

**Angina pectoris:**
- Reduce myocardial oxygen demand via afterload reduction
- Non-DHPs preferred (less reflex tachycardia)
- Verapamil/diltiazem for vasospastic (Prinzmetal's) angina

**Arrhythmias:**
- Verapamil/diltiazem: Rate control in atrial fibrillation/flutter
- Verapamil: Acute SVT termination (IV)
- DHPs have no role in arrhythmia management

**Other:**
- Raynaud's phenomenon (nifedipine)
- Cerebral vasospasm prevention (nimodipine — post-subarachnoid hemorrhage)
- Hypertrophic cardiomyopathy (verapamil)

## Adverse Effects

### DHP-Specific
- Peripheral edema (ankle swelling) — dose-dependent, due to precapillary vasodilation
- Facial flushing, headache
- Dizziness
- Reflex tachycardia (short-acting agents)
- Gingival hyperplasia (rare)
- Constipation (less common than with verapamil)

### Non-DHP-Specific
- **Verapamil**: Constipation (most common side effect, up to 25%), bradycardia, heart block, negative inotropy, hypotension
- **Diltiazem**: Bradycardia, heart block (less pronounced than verapamil), ankle edema, headache

### All CCBs
- Hypotension
- Dizziness
- Headache

## Contraindications

**All CCBs:**
- Severe hypotension (SBP <90 mmHg)
- Acute decompensated heart failure

**Non-DHPs (verapamil/diltiazem):**
- Second or third-degree AV block (without pacemaker)
- Sick sinus syndrome (without pacemaker)
- Severe LV dysfunction (EF <30%)
- Concurrent IV beta-blocker use (risk of asystole)
- WPW syndrome with atrial fibrillation

**DHPs:**
- Unstable angina (short-acting nifedipine without concurrent beta-blocker)
- Severe aortic stenosis

## Drug Interactions

| Drug | Interaction |
|------|-------------|
| Beta-blockers + non-DHP CCBs | Additive bradycardia, AV block, heart failure (avoid IV combination) |
| Digoxin + verapamil/diltiazem | Increased digoxin levels (reduce digoxin dose by 50%) |
| Clopidogrel | CCBs reduce antiplatelet effect via CYP3A4 inhibition |
| Statins (simvastatin, atorvastatin) | Verapamil/diltiazem increase statin levels (CYP3A4 inhibition) — rhabdomyolysis risk |
| Cyclosporine | Non-DHPs increase cyclosporine levels |
| CYP3A4 inhibitors (ketoconazole, erythromycin) | Increased CCB levels |
| Grapefruit juice | Increased DHP bioavailability (CYP3A4 inhibition in gut) |
| Dantrolene | Severe hyperkalemia and cardiovascular collapse with verapamil |

## CCB Selection Guide

| Clinical Scenario | Preferred Agent |
|-------------------|-----------------|
| Hypertension (general) | Amlodipine |
| Hypertension (Black patients, elderly) | Amlodipine, nifedipine ER |
| Stable angina | Diltiazem, verapamil, or amlodipine |
| Vasospastic angina | Verapamil, diltiazem, nifedipine |
| AF/Flutter rate control | Diltiazem, verapamil |
| SVT | Verapamil (IV) |
| Raynaud's phenomenon | Nifedipine |
| Cerebral vasospasm | Nimodipine |
| HF with preserved EF | Amlodipine (only CCB safe in HF) |

## Overdose

CCB toxicity is a medical emergency presenting with:
- Profound bradycardia and hypotension
- AV conduction abnormalities
- Cardiogenic shock
- Hyperglycemia (impaired insulin release)

Management: IV calcium, high-dose insulin-euglycemia therapy, vasopressors, IV lipid emulsion, possible mechanical circulatory support.
