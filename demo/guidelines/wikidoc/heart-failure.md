# Heart Failure

## Definition

Heart failure (HF) is a complex clinical syndrome characterized by the heart's inability to pump sufficient blood to meet the body's metabolic demands, or the ability to do so only at elevated filling pressures. Also known as congestive heart failure (CHF), it results in reduced cardiac output and fluid accumulation in the lungs, extremities, and other tissues.

## Pathophysiology

Heart failure involves two primary mechanisms of dysfunction:

**Systolic dysfunction** occurs when the heart cannot contract effectively, reducing the left ventricle's ability to eject blood. This leads to heart failure with reduced ejection fraction (HFrEF, EF <=40%).

**Diastolic dysfunction** involves impaired ventricular relaxation and filling. The ventricle is stiff or noncompliant, leading to elevated filling pressures despite relatively preserved contractile function. This defines heart failure with preserved ejection fraction (HFpEF, EF >=50%).

**Heart failure with mildly reduced ejection fraction (HFmrEF)** describes patients with EF 41-49%.

Compensatory mechanisms initially maintain cardiac output but become maladaptive over time:
- Neurohormonal activation (RAAS, sympathetic nervous system)
- Ventricular remodeling (dilation, hypertrophy)
- Sodium and water retention
- Increased systemic vascular resistance

## Classification

### By Ejection Fraction
- **HFrEF**: EF <=40% (systolic heart failure)
- **HFmrEF**: EF 41-49%
- **HFpEF**: EF >=50% (diastolic heart failure)

### ACC/AHA Staging
- **Stage A**: At risk for HF but no structural disease or symptoms (e.g., hypertension, diabetes)
- **Stage B**: Structural heart disease but no HF symptoms (e.g., prior MI, LVH, low EF)
- **Stage C**: Structural disease with current or prior HF symptoms
- **Stage D**: Refractory HF requiring advanced therapies

### NYHA Functional Classification
- **Class I**: No limitation of physical activity
- **Class II**: Slight limitation; comfortable at rest, symptomatic with ordinary activity
- **Class III**: Marked limitation; comfortable at rest, symptomatic with less than ordinary activity
- **Class IV**: Unable to carry on any physical activity without symptoms; symptoms at rest

## Etiology

- Ischemic heart disease (most common cause in developed countries)
- Hypertension
- Valvular heart disease (aortic stenosis, mitral regurgitation)
- Dilated cardiomyopathy (idiopathic, familial, toxic)
- Myocarditis (viral, autoimmune)
- Hypertrophic cardiomyopathy
- Arrhythmia-induced (tachycardia-mediated cardiomyopathy)
- Congenital heart disease
- Infiltrative diseases (amyloidosis, sarcoidosis, hemochromatosis)
- Thyroid disease, peripartum cardiomyopathy

## Clinical Features

**Symptoms:**
- Dyspnea (exertional, orthopnea, paroxysmal nocturnal dyspnea)
- Fatigue and exercise intolerance
- Peripheral edema (ankle, leg swelling)
- Weight gain from fluid retention
- Persistent cough (especially when lying down)
- Abdominal distension, early satiety (hepatic congestion)

**Signs:**
- Elevated jugular venous pressure
- Pulmonary crackles/rales
- S3 gallop (pathognomonic for volume overload)
- Peripheral edema, ascites
- Hepatomegaly
- Displaced apical impulse (cardiomegaly)

## Diagnosis

- **BNP/NT-proBNP**: Elevated in heart failure; useful for diagnosis and monitoring
- **Echocardiography**: Essential for EF measurement, wall motion, valvular assessment, diastolic function
- **Chest X-ray**: Cardiomegaly, pulmonary congestion, pleural effusions
- **ECG**: May show LVH, prior MI, arrhythmias, conduction delays
- **Cardiac MRI**: Myocardial fibrosis, infiltrative disease, precise EF
- **Laboratory**: CBC, metabolic panel, thyroid function, iron studies, urinalysis
- **Coronary angiography**: When ischemic etiology is suspected

## Treatment

### Guideline-Directed Medical Therapy (GDMT) for HFrEF

Four pillars of therapy (all patients should receive unless contraindicated):

1. **ACE inhibitor or ARNI** (sacubitril/valsartan preferred over ACEi)
2. **Beta-blocker** (bisoprolol, carvedilol, or sustained-release metoprolol succinate)
3. **Mineralocorticoid receptor antagonist** (spironolactone or eplerenone)
4. **SGLT2 inhibitor** (dapagliflozin or empagliflozin)

**Additional therapies:**
- Loop diuretics for congestion relief (furosemide, bumetanide, torsemide)
- Hydralazine + isosorbide dinitrate (especially in Black patients or ACEi-intolerant)
- Ivabradine (if HR >70 bpm despite maximized beta-blocker)
- Digoxin (for symptom relief, not mortality benefit)

### Device Therapy
- **ICD**: Primary prevention if EF <=35% despite >=3 months optimal medical therapy
- **CRT**: If EF <=35% with LBBB and QRS >=150 ms

### Lifestyle Modifications
- Sodium restriction (<2g/day)
- Fluid restriction (1.5-2L/day if hyponatremic)
- Daily weight monitoring
- Regular moderate exercise (cardiac rehabilitation)
- Smoking and alcohol cessation

### Advanced Therapies (Stage D)
- Mechanical circulatory support (LVAD)
- Heart transplantation
- Palliative care

## Prognosis

- 5-year mortality approximately 50% after diagnosis
- Annual mortality 25-30% for NYHA Class IV
- GDMT has significantly improved outcomes: beta-blockers reduce absolute mortality by 4.5% over 13 months
- HFpEF has slightly better prognosis than HFrEF but significant morbidity
- Key prognostic factors: EF, NYHA class, BNP levels, renal function, age, comorbidities
