# Premature Ventricular Contractions (PVCs)

## Definition

Premature ventricular contractions (PVCs) are early electrical impulses originating from the ventricles, occurring before the next expected sinus beat. Also known as premature ventricular beats, ventricular ectopic beats, or ventricular extrasystoles, PVCs are among the most common cardiac arrhythmias, found in up to 75% of healthy individuals on 24-hour Holter monitoring.

## Pathophysiology

PVCs arise through three primary mechanisms:

- **Enhanced automaticity**: Ectopic ventricular focus fires spontaneously due to increased automaticity of ventricular myocytes, often triggered by catecholamines, electrolyte imbalances, or ischemia.
- **Triggered activity**: Early or delayed afterdepolarizations reach threshold and generate premature impulses. Delayed afterdepolarizations are associated with digitalis toxicity and catecholamine excess.
- **Re-entry**: A circuitous electrical pathway within ventricular tissue allows impulse re-entry, commonly at the border zone of myocardial scar tissue.

The premature ventricular depolarization produces a wide QRS complex (>120 ms) on ECG, typically followed by a compensatory pause as the AV node resets.

## Classification

PVCs are classified by several criteria:

**By morphology:**
- Unifocal (monomorphic): Single ectopic focus, consistent QRS morphology
- Multifocal (polymorphic): Multiple ectopic foci, varying QRS morphology

**By frequency and pattern:**
- Isolated PVCs
- Bigeminy: Every other beat is a PVC
- Trigeminy: Every third beat is a PVC
- Couplets: Two consecutive PVCs
- Non-sustained ventricular tachycardia (NSVT): Three or more consecutive PVCs

**By origin:**
- Right ventricular outflow tract (RVOT) origin: Most common in structurally normal hearts, LBBB morphology with inferior axis
- Left ventricular origin: RBBB morphology

**PVC burden** is expressed as a percentage of total heartbeats over 24 hours. A burden exceeding 10-15% is associated with PVC-induced cardiomyopathy.

## Causes and Risk Factors

- Structural heart disease (ischemic cardiomyopathy, valvular disease, hypertrophic cardiomyopathy)
- Electrolyte imbalances (hypokalemia, hypomagnesemia, hypercalcemia)
- Stimulants (caffeine, nicotine, alcohol, sympathomimetic drugs)
- Medications (digitalis, theophylline, tricyclic antidepressants)
- Hyperthyroidism
- Hypoxia
- Myocarditis
- Mitral valve prolapse
- Idiopathic (common in structurally normal hearts)

## Clinical Features

Many patients with PVCs are asymptomatic. When symptomatic, common complaints include:

- Palpitations or "skipped beats"
- Sensation of the heart "fluttering" or "pounding"
- Chest discomfort
- Lightheadedness or dizziness
- Presyncope (rare)
- Anxiety related to perceived cardiac irregularity

Frequent PVCs (>10-15% burden) may lead to PVC-induced cardiomyopathy with symptoms of heart failure: dyspnea, fatigue, and exercise intolerance.

## Diagnosis

- **12-lead ECG**: Wide QRS complex (>120 ms), no preceding P wave, compensatory pause, ST-T changes discordant to QRS vector
- **24-hour Holter monitor**: Quantifies PVC burden, identifies patterns (bigeminy, couplets, NSVT)
- **Event monitor / Loop recorder**: For infrequent symptoms
- **Echocardiography**: Assess ventricular function and rule out structural heart disease
- **Cardiac MRI**: Evaluate for myocardial scar, fibrosis, or infiltrative disease
- **Exercise stress testing**: Assess PVC behavior during exertion (suppression with exercise suggests benign etiology)
- **Laboratory**: Electrolytes (K+, Mg2+, Ca2+), thyroid function, toxicology screen

## Treatment

### Conservative Management
- Reassurance for asymptomatic patients with structurally normal hearts
- Avoidance of triggers (caffeine, alcohol, stimulants, sleep deprivation)
- Stress reduction and regular exercise

### Pharmacological Therapy
- **Beta-blockers** (first-line): Propranolol, metoprolol, or atenolol. Effective for symptom relief and reducing PVC burden, particularly for catecholamine-sensitive PVCs.
- **Calcium channel blockers**: Verapamil or diltiazem for patients intolerant of beta-blockers.
- **Antiarrhythmic drugs** (second-line): Flecainide, propafenone (Class IC) for refractory cases in structurally normal hearts. Amiodarone for patients with structural heart disease.

### Catheter Ablation
- Recommended for symptomatic PVCs refractory to medical therapy, high PVC burden (>10-15%), or PVC-induced cardiomyopathy
- Success rates of 80-90% for RVOT-origin PVCs
- Lower success rates for epicardial or papillary muscle origins

## Prognosis

- **Benign PVCs** (structurally normal heart, low burden): Excellent long-term prognosis with no increase in mortality
- **PVCs with structural heart disease**: Associated with increased risk of sustained ventricular arrhythmias and sudden cardiac death
- **PVC-induced cardiomyopathy**: Often reversible with successful PVC suppression (ablation or medical therapy)
- PVC burden >24% is an independent predictor of cardiomyopathy development
