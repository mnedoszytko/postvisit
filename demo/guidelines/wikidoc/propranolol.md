# Propranolol

## Overview

Propranolol is a non-selective beta-adrenergic receptor antagonist and the first clinically successful beta-blocker. Developed by Sir James Black in 1964 (Nobel Prize in Medicine, 1988), it remains one of the most widely prescribed beta-blockers worldwide. It is available as immediate-release (propranolol hydrochloride) and extended-release (propranolol LA) formulations.

## Mechanism of Action

Propranolol competitively blocks both beta-1 and beta-2 adrenergic receptors:

- **Beta-1 blockade** (heart, kidneys): Decreases heart rate, contractility, AV conduction, and renin release
- **Beta-2 blockade** (lungs, vasculature, liver): Causes bronchial smooth muscle constriction, peripheral vasoconstriction, and inhibits glycogenolysis
- **Membrane-stabilizing activity**: At high doses, exerts quinidine-like effect on cardiac action potential
- **Lipophilic**: Readily crosses blood-brain barrier, contributing to both CNS therapeutic effects and side effects

## Pharmacokinetics

| Parameter | Value |
|-----------|-------|
| Bioavailability | 26% (high first-pass metabolism) |
| Protein binding | 90% |
| Half-life | 3-6 hours (IR), 8-10 hours (LA) |
| Metabolism | Hepatic (CYP2D6, CYP1A2) |
| Active metabolite | 4-hydroxypropranolol |
| Excretion | Renal (>90% as metabolites) |

## Indications

**FDA-approved:**
- Hypertension
- Angina pectoris
- Atrial fibrillation (rate control)
- Myocardial infarction (secondary prevention)
- Essential tremor
- Migraine prophylaxis
- Pheochromocytoma (adjunct to alpha-blocker)
- Hypertrophic obstructive cardiomyopathy (HOCM)

**Common off-label uses:**
- Performance anxiety / stage fright
- Premature ventricular contractions (PVCs)
- Thyrotoxicosis symptom control
- Portal hypertension / variceal bleeding prophylaxis
- Infantile hemangioma (oral solution — FDA-approved as Hemangeol)
- PTSD-related hyperarousal
- Akathisia

## Dosing

### Hypertension
- Initial: 40 mg twice daily (IR) or 80 mg once daily (LA)
- Maintenance: 120-240 mg/day
- Maximum: 640 mg/day

### Premature Ventricular Contractions / Arrhythmias
- 10-30 mg three to four times daily (IR)
- Titrate based on heart rate response and symptom control

### Migraine Prophylaxis
- Initial: 80 mg/day in divided doses
- Maintenance: 160-240 mg/day

### Essential Tremor
- Initial: 40 mg twice daily
- Maintenance: 120-320 mg/day

### Performance Anxiety
- 10-40 mg as single dose, 30-60 minutes before event

### Portal Hypertension
- Titrate to reduce resting heart rate by 25% (typically 40-320 mg/day)

## Contraindications

- Severe sinus bradycardia (HR <50 bpm)
- Second or third-degree heart block (without pacemaker)
- Cardiogenic shock or decompensated heart failure
- Severe asthma or bronchospastic disease
- Sinus node dysfunction
- Hypotension (SBP <90 mmHg)
- Pheochromocytoma without prior alpha-blockade
- Known hypersensitivity to propranolol

## Adverse Effects

**Common (>1%):**
- Fatigue, lethargy
- Bradycardia
- Cold extremities
- Dizziness
- Nausea, diarrhea
- Sleep disturbances (insomnia, vivid dreams, nightmares)
- Depression

**Serious:**
- Bronchospasm (especially in asthma/COPD)
- Severe bradycardia or heart block
- Hypotension
- Heart failure exacerbation
- Hypoglycemia (masks tachycardic warning signs)
- Raynaud's phenomenon

**Withdrawal:** Abrupt discontinuation can cause rebound tachycardia, hypertension, angina exacerbation, and rarely MI. Always taper over 1-2 weeks.

## Drug Interactions

| Interaction | Effect |
|-------------|--------|
| Verapamil / Diltiazem | Additive bradycardia, AV block, hypotension |
| Digitalis glycosides | Enhanced AV block |
| CYP2D6 inhibitors (fluoxetine, paroxetine, quinidine) | Increased propranolol levels |
| CYP1A2 inhibitors (cimetidine, ciprofloxacin) | Increased propranolol levels |
| CYP1A2 inducers (rifampin, smoking) | Decreased propranolol levels |
| Insulin / oral hypoglycemics | Prolonged hypoglycemia, masked symptoms |
| NSAIDs | Reduced antihypertensive effect |
| Aluminum hydroxide antacids | Reduced propranolol absorption |
| Theophylline | Mutual clearance reduction |
| Clonidine | Risk of severe rebound HTN if clonidine withdrawn |
| Epinephrine | Unopposed alpha stimulation (severe HTN) |

## Special Populations

- **Hepatic impairment**: Significantly increased bioavailability due to reduced first-pass metabolism. Reduce dose.
- **Renal impairment**: No dose adjustment required (hepatic metabolism).
- **Elderly**: Start low (10-20 mg twice daily), titrate slowly. Increased sensitivity to CNS effects.
- **Pregnancy**: Category C. Use only if benefit outweighs risk. Associated with IUGR, neonatal bradycardia, hypoglycemia.
- **Breastfeeding**: Excreted in breast milk; amount generally considered compatible but monitor infant.
- **Diabetes**: Use with caution — masks hypoglycemia symptoms. Cardioselective beta-blockers preferred.
- **Thyrotoxicosis**: Effective for symptom control but does not treat underlying disease.
