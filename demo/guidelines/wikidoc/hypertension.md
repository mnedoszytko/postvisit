# Hypertension

## Definition

Hypertension is a chronic medical condition in which systemic arterial blood pressure is persistently elevated. Per 2017 ACC/AHA guidelines, hypertension is defined as blood pressure greater than or equal to 130/80 mmHg, representing a lowering from the previous 140/90 mmHg threshold. It is a leading cause of cardiovascular mortality worldwide.

## Classification

**By blood pressure level (2017 ACC/AHA):**

| Category | Systolic (mmHg) | Diastolic (mmHg) |
|----------|-----------------|-------------------|
| Normal | <120 | <80 |
| Elevated | 120-129 | <80 |
| Stage 1 HTN | 130-139 | 80-89 |
| Stage 2 HTN | >=140 | >=90 |

**By etiology:**
- **Primary (essential) hypertension** (90-95%): Gradual onset, multifactorial, associated with obesity, sodium intake, inactivity, alcohol use, and genetic predisposition.
- **Secondary hypertension** (5%): Caused by identifiable conditions including renovascular disease, primary aldosteronism, pheochromocytoma, obstructive sleep apnea, chronic kidney disease, Cushing syndrome, or coarctation of the aorta.

**Special categories:**
- **Resistant hypertension**: BP above goal despite three concurrent antihypertensives (including a diuretic)
- **Refractory hypertension**: Failure to control despite five or more medication classes

## Pathophysiology

Hypertension results from dysfunction in multiple regulatory systems:

- **Renin-angiotensin-aldosterone system (RAAS)**: Angiotensin II causes vasoconstriction and aldosterone-mediated sodium retention
- **Sympathetic nervous system**: Increased catecholamine activity raises heart rate and peripheral resistance
- **Endothelial dysfunction**: Impaired nitric oxide production reduces vasodilation
- **Natriuretic peptide system**: Impaired sodium excretion
- **Genetic factors**: Polygenic disorder involving approximately 25 rare mutations and 120+ SNPs

In salt-sensitive patients, increased TGF-beta contributes to elevated systolic pressure through endothelial dysfunction and vascular remodeling.

## Risk Factors

**Modifiable:** Obesity, high sodium intake, physical inactivity, excessive alcohol, poor diet, psychological stress, obstructive sleep apnea.

**Non-modifiable:** Advanced age, male sex, family history, Black race, chronic kidney disease.

**Pharmacological causes:** NSAIDs, oral contraceptives, decongestants, corticosteroids, amphetamines, recreational drugs.

## Clinical Features

Most patients with primary hypertension are asymptomatic. Symptoms, when present, are usually related to target organ damage or secondary causes:
- Headache (typically occipital, early morning)
- Visual disturbances
- Dyspnea on exertion
- Chest pain
- Epistaxis (rarely)
- Secondary HTN symptoms: palpitations, diaphoresis, muscle cramps, abdominal pain

## Diagnosis

Blood pressure measurement protocol:
- Patient at rest >5 minutes, seated with back supported
- Avoid caffeine and exercise for 30 minutes prior
- Appropriate cuff size
- Measure both arms at initial visit
- Average of >=2 readings on >=2 occasions

**Laboratory assessment:** Fasting glucose, lipid panel, serum creatinine with eGFR, electrolytes (Na+, K+), TSH, urinalysis, CBC.

**Additional testing:** ECG (LVH screening), echocardiography, renal ultrasound/Doppler (if renovascular disease suspected), aldosterone-to-renin ratio (primary aldosteronism screening), 24-hour urine catecholamines (pheochromocytoma).

## Treatment

### Lifestyle Modifications (All Patients)
- Weight reduction: ~1 mmHg reduction per kg lost
- Sodium restriction: <1500 mg/day
- Potassium intake: 3500-5000 mg/day
- Aerobic exercise: 90-150 minutes/week
- DASH diet: Rich in fruits, vegetables, whole grains, low-fat dairy
- Alcohol limitation: <=2 drinks/day men, <=1 drink/day women
- Smoking cessation

### Pharmacological Therapy

**First-line agents:**
- Thiazide-type diuretics (chlorthalidone preferred over HCTZ)
- ACE inhibitors
- Angiotensin receptor blockers (ARBs)
- Calcium channel blockers (amlodipine, nifedipine)

**Beta-blockers** are reserved for patients with concurrent ischemic heart disease, heart failure, or rate control needs.

**Treatment targets:** Generally <130/80 mmHg for most patients including those >=65 years.

**Resistant hypertension:** Add spironolactone (most effective fourth agent), hydralazine, or minoxidil.

**Special populations:**
- Black patients: Thiazides or CCBs preferred first-line (ACEi/ARB less effective as monotherapy)
- CKD with proteinuria: ACEi or ARB mandatory
- Pregnancy: Labetalol, nifedipine, or methyldopa

## Prognosis and Complications

Without treatment, approximately one-third of hypertensive patients develop MI or stroke. Ten-year mortality approaches 11%.

**Target organ damage:**
- **Heart**: LVH, coronary artery disease, heart failure, atrial fibrillation
- **Brain**: Stroke (ischemic and hemorrhagic), vascular dementia
- **Kidney**: Chronic kidney disease, nephrosclerosis
- **Eyes**: Hypertensive retinopathy
- **Vasculature**: Aortic aneurysm, peripheral arterial disease

Patients with resistant hypertension have 2-7x higher rates of MI, stroke, and ESRD compared to those with controlled BP.

## Follow-up

Monthly reassessment during medication titration. Once BP at target, monitoring every 3-6 months with annual laboratory reassessment.
