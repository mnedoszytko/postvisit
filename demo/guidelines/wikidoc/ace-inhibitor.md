# ACE Inhibitors

## Overview

Angiotensin-converting enzyme (ACE) inhibitors are a pharmaceutical class used primarily to treat hypertension and congestive heart failure, often as first-line agents. They work by inhibiting the angiotensin-converting enzyme, which converts inactive angiotensin I to the potent vasoconstrictor angiotensin II in the pulmonary circulation.

## Mechanism of Action

By blocking ACE, these drugs prevent:
- Conversion of angiotensin I to angiotensin II (a potent vasoconstrictor)
- Aldosterone release (reducing sodium and water retention)
- Bradykinin degradation (leading to increased vasodilation via nitric oxide and prostaglandins)

The net effect is reduced peripheral vascular resistance, decreased blood volume, and lower blood pressure with reduced cardiac workload.

## Classification and Common Agents

### Sulfhydryl-Containing
- **Captopril** (Capoten): First ACE inhibitor, short-acting (t1/2 2-3 hours), requires BID-TID dosing

### Dicarboxylate-Containing (Largest Group)
- **Enalapril** (Vasotec): Intermediate half-life (t1/2 4-8 hours)
- **Lisinopril** (Prinivil/Zestril): Long-acting (t1/2 12-14 hours), not hepatically metabolized
- **Ramipril** (Altace): Strong evidence for cardiovascular protection (HOPE trial)
- **Quinapril** (Accupril)
- **Perindopril** (Coversyl/Aceon)
- **Benazepril** (Lotensin)

### Phosphonate-Containing
- **Fosinopril** (Monopril): Dual hepatic/renal elimination, useful in renal impairment

## Indications

- Hypertension (first-line)
- Heart failure with reduced ejection fraction (GDMT cornerstone)
- Left ventricular dysfunction (post-MI remodeling prevention)
- Diabetic nephropathy (renoprotective independent of BP lowering)
- Chronic kidney disease with proteinuria
- Cardiovascular risk reduction in high-risk patients

ACE inhibitors reduce the progress of diabetic nephropathy independently from their blood pressure-lowering effect.

## Dosing

| Agent | Initial Dose | Maintenance | Notes |
|-------|-------------|-------------|-------|
| Captopril | 12.5-25 mg BID-TID | 25-50 mg BID-TID | CHF test dose: 6.25 mg |
| Enalapril | 2.5-5 mg daily | 10-40 mg daily | Reduce if GFR <30 |
| Lisinopril | 5-10 mg daily | 20-40 mg daily | No hepatic metabolism |
| Ramipril | 1.25-2.5 mg daily | 10 mg daily | Strong CV evidence |
| Benazepril | 10 mg daily | 20-40 mg daily | Reduce if CrCl <30 |

**Heart failure initiation:** Start low and titrate slowly. Captopril 6.25 mg test dose recommended to assess hypotension risk. Titrate to target doses over weeks to months.

## Contraindications

**Absolute:**
- Prior angioedema associated with ACE inhibitor use
- Bilateral renal artery stenosis (or unilateral with solitary kidney)
- Pregnancy (Category D) — teratogenic in 2nd/3rd trimesters (cardiovascular and CNS malformations)
- Concurrent use with aliskiren in diabetic patients

**Relative / Use with Caution:**
- Impaired renal function (monitor creatinine and potassium)
- Aortic valve stenosis
- Hypovolemia or dehydration
- Hyperkalemia (K+ >5.5 mEq/L)
- High-flux hemodialysis membranes

## Adverse Effects

**Common (>=1%):**
- **Dry cough**: 10-15% incidence, related to increased bradykinin. Most common reason for discontinuation. Switch to ARB if intolerable.
- **Hypotension**: Especially first dose, particularly in volume-depleted patients or those on diuretics
- **Hyperkalemia**: Monitor potassium, especially with K+-sparing diuretics, NSAIDs, or CKD
- **Dizziness, headache, fatigue**
- **Nausea**
- **Renal function decline**: Up to 30% creatinine rise acceptable; >30% suggests bilateral RAS

**Serious but rare:**
- **Angioedema**: ~0.1% incidence, potentially life-threatening. Higher in Black patients. Contraindication to re-challenge.
- **Neutropenia**: 1:8,600 (captopril-specific, associated with high doses and renal impairment)

**Captopril-specific:** Taste disturbances (2-7%), skin rash (4-10%), proteinuria (1%)

## Drug Interactions

| Drug | Effect |
|------|--------|
| NSAIDs | Reduced antihypertensive effect; "triple whammy" (ACEi + NSAID + diuretic) increases acute kidney injury risk |
| Potassium-sparing diuretics / K+ supplements | Hyperkalemia risk |
| Lithium | Increased lithium levels — monitor closely |
| Thiazide diuretics | Additive hypotension (first-dose effect) |
| Digoxin | Captopril increases digoxin levels |
| Aliskiren | Contraindicated combination in diabetics |

## ACE Inhibitors in Heart Failure

ACE inhibitors are cornerstone GDMT for HFrEF, reducing mortality and hospitalization. Key principles:
- Start at low dose, titrate to evidence-based target doses
- Diuretics remain first-line for congestion; ACE inhibitors are primarily second-line (less effective without concurrent diuretic)
- Monitor renal function and potassium at each dose titration
- If ACEi not tolerated (cough/angioedema), switch to ARB or ARNI

## ACE Inhibitors vs. ARBs

ARBs (losartan, valsartan, candesartan) block the angiotensin II receptor directly. They do not increase bradykinin, resulting in lower cough and angioedema rates. ARBs are first-line alternatives for ACEi-intolerant patients. Do not combine ACEi + ARB (increased adverse effects without benefit in most populations).
