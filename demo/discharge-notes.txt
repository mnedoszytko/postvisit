DISCHARGE SUMMARY / VISIT NOTES
================================================================

CITY HEART CLINIC — Cardiology Department
Date of Visit: February 10, 2026
Provider: Michael Nedo, MD — Cardiology
Patient: Alex Johnson
DOB: March 15, 1985 (Age: 41)
MRN: MRN-001

================================================================
CHIEF COMPLAINT
================================================================
Heart palpitations for approximately two weeks.

================================================================
HISTORY OF PRESENT ILLNESS
================================================================
Mr. Johnson is a 41-year-old male with no significant past medical
history who presents with a two-week history of palpitations. He
describes the sensation as his heart "skipping a beat" or producing
an extra beat, with associated brief fluttering in the chest. Symptoms
began gradually, initially noticed at rest while lying in bed at night,
and subsequently during the daytime while sedentary at work.

Frequency varies from a few episodes per day to episodes occurring
every few minutes. Episodes are typically single premature beats,
with occasional brief runs of 2-3 beats lasting only seconds.
Patient denies sustained palpitations.

Associated symptoms: Occasional brief lightheadedness immediately
following a strong premature beat, resolving within seconds.
Denies chest pain, dyspnea, syncope, or pre-syncope.

Aggravating factors: Patient reports significantly increased
occupational stress over the past several weeks due to a major
project deadline. Caffeine intake has increased to 4-5 cups of
coffee daily. Sleep has been reduced due to extended work hours.
Exercise frequency has decreased from 3-4x/week to approximately
1x/week.

Alcohol: Occasional, 1-2 beers on weekends.
Tobacco: Denies.
Recreational drugs: Denies.
Supplements: Daily multivitamin only.

================================================================
PAST MEDICAL HISTORY
================================================================
No significant past medical history.
No prior surgeries.
No known drug allergies (NKDA).
No current medications.
Last routine physical: approximately 1 year ago, unremarkable.

================================================================
FAMILY HISTORY
================================================================
Father: Hypertension, medically managed.
No family history of sudden cardiac death, cardiomyopathy,
arrhythmias, or premature coronary artery disease.

================================================================
PHYSICAL EXAMINATION
================================================================
General: Well-appearing male, no acute distress.
Vitals:
  - Blood Pressure: 140/90 mmHg (left arm, seated)
  - Heart Rate: 78 bpm (irregular — occasional premature beats)
  - Respiratory Rate: 16/min
  - SpO2: 99% on room air
  - Temperature: 98.4°F (36.9°C)
  - BMI: 26.2

Cardiovascular:
  - Heart sounds: S1/S2 normal.
  - Rhythm: Irregularly irregular with premature beats.
  - Murmur: Grade I/VI systolic murmur at apex, consistent with
    mild mitral regurgitation.
  - No S3, S4, rubs, or gallops.
  - JVP not elevated.
  - Carotid upstrokes normal, no bruits.

Pulmonary: Clear to auscultation bilaterally.
Extremities: No edema, peripheral pulses 2+ and symmetric.
Neurological: Alert and oriented, no focal deficits.

================================================================
DIAGNOSTIC STUDIES
================================================================

12-Lead EKG:
  - Rate: 78 bpm
  - Rhythm: Normal sinus rhythm with frequent PVCs
  - PR Interval: 160 ms (normal)
  - QRS Duration: 88 ms (normal); PVC complexes 140 ms (wide)
  - QTc: 420 ms (normal)
  - Axis: Normal
  - ST/T changes: None
  - Interpretation: Normal sinus rhythm with premature ventricular
    contractions (PVCs). No ST-T wave abnormalities. No evidence
    of ischemia, hypertrophy, or conduction delay.

Transthoracic Echocardiogram (TTE):
  - LV function: Normal. LVEF 55% (biplane Simpson's).
  - LV dimensions: Normal. No hypertrophy.
  - LV wall motion: Normal, no regional wall motion abnormalities.
  - RV function: Normal. TAPSE 22 mm.
  - Valves:
    - Mitral valve: Mild regurgitation (trace-to-mild). Leaflets
      normal morphology. No prolapse.
    - Aortic valve: Trileaflet, no stenosis or regurgitation.
    - Tricuspid valve: Trace regurgitation (physiologic).
    - Pulmonic valve: Normal.
  - Atria: Normal size bilaterally.
  - No pericardial effusion.
  - Aortic root: Normal diameter.
  - Estimated RVSP: Normal.
  - Interpretation: Normal biventricular function and structure.
    Mild mitral regurgitation, clinically insignificant. No
    structural basis for arrhythmia identified.

Laboratory (ordered, results pending):
  - TSH (thyroid function)
  - Basic Metabolic Panel (electrolytes, potassium, creatinine)
  - Complete Blood Count
  - Lipid Panel

================================================================
ASSESSMENT
================================================================
1. Premature Ventricular Contractions (PVCs)
   ICD-10: I49.3
   - Frequent PVCs confirmed on 12-lead EKG
   - Likely related to increased stress, caffeine, and sleep
     deprivation
   - Structurally normal heart on echocardiogram
   - No high-risk features (no sustained VT, normal EF, no
     syncope, no family history of SCD)
   - Classification: Benign, symptomatic

2. Elevated Blood Pressure
   ICD-10: R03.0
   - 140/90 mmHg, single reading
   - May be situational (white coat, stress, caffeine)
   - Will reassess on follow-up after lifestyle modifications
     and beta-blocker therapy

3. Mild Mitral Valve Regurgitation
   ICD-10: I34.0
   - Trace-to-mild, clinically insignificant
   - Normal valve morphology, no prolapse
   - No treatment needed, routine monitoring

================================================================
PLAN
================================================================

MEDICATIONS:
  - START: Propranolol 40 mg PO BID (twice daily)
    Indication: PVC suppression and heart rate/BP control
    Instructions: Take with food. Do not discontinue abruptly.
    Dispense: 30-day supply, 3 refills

LIFESTYLE MODIFICATIONS:
  - Reduce caffeine to 1-2 cups/day maximum, none after noon
  - Resume regular exercise: 30 min moderate activity 3-4x/week
  - Prioritize sleep hygiene: 7-8 hours/night, regular schedule
  - Stress management techniques (exercise, mindfulness,
    counseling if needed)

FOLLOW-UP:
  - Return visit in 2 weeks:
    - Reassess blood pressure
    - Evaluate PVC symptom response to propranolol
    - Review laboratory results
  - 24-hour Holter monitor: Schedule at next visit to quantify
    PVC burden
  - Repeat echocardiogram in 12 months (routine surveillance of
    mitral regurgitation)

LABS ORDERED (today):
  - TSH
  - Basic Metabolic Panel
  - CBC
  - Lipid Panel

PATIENT EDUCATION:
  - Discussed nature of PVCs — common, usually benign when
    heart structure is normal
  - Discussed propranolol mechanism, expected benefits, and
    potential side effects (fatigue, lightheadedness on standing,
    cold extremities, reduced exercise heart rate)
  - Emphasized: do not stop propranolol abruptly
  - Discussed significance of mild mitral regurgitation (benign,
    monitoring only)

RETURN PRECAUTIONS:
  - Seek immediate medical attention for: sustained palpitations
    lasting >30 seconds, chest pain, syncope or near-syncope,
    severe dizziness, shortness of breath at rest
