    "clean_transcript": "Doctor: Mr. Washington, good afternoon. I'm Dr. Okafor, your pulmonologist. Please, have a seat. I see you've been having some trouble breathing lately.\n\nPatient: Yes, doc. It's been about four weeks now. The cough has gotten really bad — I'm bringing up a lot of phlegm, yellow-green stuff. And the shortness of breath, it's worse than usual. I can barely walk to the mailbox without stopping to catch my breath.\n\nDoctor: That's concerning. Has this come on gradually, or was there a sudden change?\n\nPatient: It started with what I thought was a cold. Runny nose, sore throat. But then the cough got deeper and the mucus changed color. And I've been more winded than usual. My wife says she can hear me wheezing from across the room at night.\n\nDoctor: Are you having any chest tightness or pain?\n\nPatient: Some tightness, yeah. Especially when I cough hard. No sharp pain though.\n\nDoctor: Good. And how often are you using your rescue inhaler — the albuterol?\n\nPatient: Way more than usual. I'd say six, seven times a day. Normally it's maybe once or twice.\n\nDoctor: That tells me a lot. Let me check your oxygen. Your oxygen saturation is at 91 percent right now on room air. We'd like to see that at 95 or above. Let me listen to your lungs.\n\n[Examination]\n\nDoctor: I can hear wheezing in both lungs, and some crackles at the bases. Your breathing sounds diminished, especially on the right side. Now, we did your spirometry this morning. Your FEV1 — that's the amount of air you can forcefully blow out in one second — is 42 percent of what we'd predict for a man your age and height. That puts you in the severe category for COPD.\n\nPatient: 42 percent? Last time it was around 48, wasn't it?\n\nDoctor: Yes, in October it was 48 percent. So there's been a decline, which is expected during an exacerbation. Once we treat this flare, some of that function should come back. But I want to be upfront with you — the trend over the past few years shows gradual progression of the disease.\n\nDoctor: Your peak flow is 210 liters per minute, and your white blood cell count is mildly elevated at 12.4, which suggests there may be an infectious component to this exacerbation. The good news is your BNP is normal, which means your heart is pumping fine — this is a lung problem, not a heart problem.\n\nPatient: That's a relief. My father had heart trouble too.\n\nDoctor: I understand. Now, here's what I want to do. First, I'm prescribing a Z-pack — azithromycin. You'll take 500 milligrams on the first day, then 250 milligrams for the next four days. This should help if there's a bacterial infection contributing to the exacerbation.\n\nPatient: Won't that upset my stomach?\n\nDoctor: It can cause some nausea. Take it with a light snack if that happens. Let us know if you develop any diarrhea.\n\nDoctor: Second, I want to make sure your maintenance inhalers are optimized. You're currently on Spiriva once daily and Advair twice daily. Are you using proper technique with the inhalers?\n\nPatient: I think so, but honestly, I'm not sure I'm doing it right with the Advair. The powder one is tricky.\n\nDoctor: Let me have my respiratory therapist go over the technique with you before you leave today. Proper inhaler technique makes a huge difference. If you're not getting the medication deep into your lungs, it's like not taking it at all.\n\nDoctor: Are you rinsing your mouth after using the Advair?\n\nPatient: I forget sometimes.\n\nDoctor: That's important. The steroid in the Advair can cause a fungal infection in your mouth — thrush — if you don't rinse. So after every dose, rinse your mouth, swish and spit.\n\nDoctor: Now, third — and I think this is really important — I want to refer you to pulmonary rehabilitation. It's a supervised exercise and education program, usually about eight weeks, two sessions a week. Studies show it significantly improves breathing capacity, exercise tolerance, and quality of life for COPD patients.\n\nPatient: Is that like going to a gym?\n\nDoctor: It's similar but tailored to people with lung disease. You'll have respiratory therapists and exercise physiologists working with you. They'll design a program that's safe for your lung function. Many of my patients tell me it's one of the most helpful things they've ever done for their COPD.\n\nPatient: I quit smoking 18 years ago. I thought that would be enough.\n\nDoctor: And quitting was the single best thing you did for your lungs. Without that, we'd be having a much more difficult conversation today. But COPD is a progressive disease, and even though you stopped the primary cause, the damage that was there continues to evolve. Our job is to slow that progression and keep you as functional as possible.\n\nPatient: What about oxygen? My wife asked me about that.\n\nDoctor: At 91 percent saturation, you're borderline. I don't think you need supplemental oxygen full-time right now, but if your levels drop below 88 during activity or sleep, we'd consider it. We can do an overnight oximetry test at some point to check that. For now, let's treat the exacerbation and reassess.\n\nPatient: When should I come back?\n\nDoctor: I want to see you in two weeks — sooner if things get worse. If you develop a high fever, your breathing gets significantly worse, or you start coughing up blood, go to the emergency room. Don't wait.\n\nDoctor: We'll repeat the spirometry at your follow-up to see if your FEV1 has recovered. And I'll put in the referral for pulmonary rehab — they'll contact you to schedule the intake appointment.\n\nPatient: OK, doc. Two weeks. I'll take the antibiotics and make sure I'm using the inhalers right.\n\nDoctor: Good man. And Jim — try to stay active within your limits. Short walks, even just around the house. Movement helps keep your lungs working. Your wife can walk with you and keep an eye on things. Any questions?\n\nPatient: No, I think you covered it all. Thank you, Dr. Okafor.\n\nDoctor: Take care, Jim. We'll get you through this.",
