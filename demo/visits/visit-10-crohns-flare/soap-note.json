    "clean_transcript": "Doctor: Hi Yukita, I'm Dr. Chen. Thanks for coming in today. I know you've been having a rough couple of weeks. Tell me what's been going on.\n\nPatient: Hi Dr. Chen. Yeah, it started about two weeks ago. The abdominal pain came back, really bad cramping, mostly on the right side. And the diarrhea — I'm going maybe eight to ten times a day now. And there's blood in it.\n\nDoctor: I'm sorry to hear that. Has this happened suddenly, or did it build up gradually?\n\nPatient: It was kind of gradual at first. I noticed more urgency and looser stools for a few days, then the blood started about a week ago. The pain has been getting worse every day. I'm barely eating because everything seems to make it worse.\n\nDoctor: Are you running any fevers?\n\nPatient: I had a low-grade fever a few days ago, like 100.4, but it went away with Tylenol.\n\nDoctor: OK. And you've been on the Humira — the adalimumab — for about three years now. Have you been keeping up with your injections?\n\nPatient: Yes, every two weeks, I haven't missed any. And I'm still taking the mesalamine three times a day.\n\nDoctor: Good. So despite being on maintenance therapy, you're having a significant flare. That's something we need to address. Let me go over your lab results that came in. Your CRP is 28 — normal is under 3 — so that tells us there's significant inflammation happening right now. Your ESR is also elevated at 42.\n\nPatient: What does ESR mean?\n\nDoctor: It's another marker of inflammation — erythrocyte sedimentation rate. When it's high along with CRP, it confirms that your body is actively fighting inflammation. Your hemoglobin is 10.2, which means you're anemic. Normal for women is 12 to 16. The blood loss from the diarrhea is contributing to that.\n\nPatient: Is that why I've been feeling so exhausted?\n\nDoctor: Absolutely. Anemia will make you feel tired, weak, sometimes short of breath or dizzy. We're going to start you on iron supplements — ferrous sulfate, 325 milligrams once a day — to help build your iron stores back up. Take it on an empty stomach if you can tolerate it, with some orange juice to help absorption. It may cause some constipation or dark stools, which is normal.\n\nPatient: OK. What about the Crohn's itself?\n\nDoctor: Your fecal calprotectin came back at 890. Normal is under 50. That's very high and tells us there's significant inflammation in your intestines. Combined with your symptoms, this is clearly an active flare. Here's what I want to do. First, I'm going to start you on prednisone — 20 milligrams daily. This is a corticosteroid that will help calm down the inflammation quickly. We'll taper it over about six weeks — I don't want you on it long-term because of side effects.\n\nPatient: What kind of side effects?\n\nDoctor: Short-term, you might notice increased appetite, trouble sleeping, mood changes, and possibly some puffiness in your face. These go away when we taper off. The reason we don't stay on it long-term is the risk of bone thinning, weight gain, and immune suppression. But right now, we need to get this flare under control.\n\nPatient: And what about the Humira? Should we change it?\n\nDoctor: For now, we'll continue the Humira. But I want to schedule a colonoscopy in about two weeks to see exactly what's happening inside. If the Humira is losing effectiveness — which can happen — we may need to switch to a different biologic. But let's get the scope first before making that decision.\n\nPatient: A colonoscopy. I had one when I was first diagnosed. It wasn't fun.\n\nDoctor: I know, the prep is the worst part. But it's really important right now. We need to see the extent of the inflammation, check for any strictures or fistulas, and take some biopsies. It'll help us make the best treatment plan going forward.\n\nDoctor: Your albumin is also low at 3.1 — normal is 3.5 to 5.5. That tells me you're not absorbing nutrients well right now. I'd like you to try to eat small, frequent meals. Avoid high-fiber foods, raw vegetables, and dairy for now. Stick to things that are easy to digest — white rice, lean chicken, bananas, applesauce.\n\nPatient: The BRAT diet?\n\nDoctor: Similar concept, yes. Just be gentle on your gut while it's inflamed. And stay hydrated — with the diarrhea, you're losing a lot of fluids. Try to drink at least eight glasses of water a day, and consider an electrolyte drink like Pedialyte.\n\nPatient: OK, I can do that. When is the colonoscopy?\n\nDoctor: We'll schedule it for about two weeks from now — February 25th. You'll need to stop the iron supplements five days before the procedure. My office will send you the bowel prep instructions. Is that date OK?\n\nPatient: Yes, I can make that work. I might need to miss a day of classes but that's fine.\n\nDoctor: Your health comes first. Now, one more thing — how are you doing emotionally? Crohn's flares can be really stressful, especially when you're in grad school.\n\nPatient: It's been tough, honestly. I feel like I'm falling behind in my research because I'm so tired and in pain all the time. It's hard to focus.\n\nDoctor: That's completely understandable. If you'd like, I can refer you to a therapist who specializes in chronic illness. Many of my patients find it helpful to have that support.\n\nPatient: Yeah, actually, I think I'd like that.\n\nDoctor: Great, I'll have my coordinator set that up. So to summarize — we're starting prednisone 20 milligrams daily with a taper schedule, continuing the Humira and mesalamine, adding iron supplements for the anemia, and scheduling a colonoscopy for February 25th. Call us if you develop a high fever, severe abdominal pain that doesn't improve, or heavy bleeding. Those would be reasons to go to the ER.\n\nPatient: Got it. Thank you, Dr. Chen. I feel better just having a plan.\n\nDoctor: Of course, Yukita. We'll get through this flare. Take care.",
