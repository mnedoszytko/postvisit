    "clean_transcript": "Doctor: Good morning, Carlos. Come on in, have a seat. I'm Dr. Patel, your endocrinologist. How have you been feeling since your last visit?\n\nPatient: Honestly, not great, doctor. My sugar numbers have been all over the place. I check in the mornings and it's usually around 170, 180. Sometimes even higher.\n\nDoctor: I see. And are you still taking the Metformin twice a day with meals?\n\nPatient: Yes, 1000 milligrams in the morning and 1000 at night. I've been pretty good about that.\n\nDoctor: Good. And the insulin at bedtime — are you taking the 20 units of Lantus every night?\n\nPatient: Most nights, yes. Sometimes I forget on weekends, I'll be honest.\n\nDoctor: That's important to be consistent with. Let me look at your latest labs here. Your HbA1c came back at 8.2 percent. Our target for you is under 7, ideally closer to 6.5. So we're quite a bit above where we want to be.\n\nPatient: Is that bad? I mean, I know it's high, but how bad is it?\n\nDoctor: It means that over the past three months, your average blood sugar has been consistently elevated. The higher it stays, the more risk we have for complications — and you're already showing some nerve damage in your feet, the neuropathy we've been monitoring.\n\nPatient: Yeah, the tingling in my feet has actually gotten worse. Especially at night, it keeps me up sometimes.\n\nDoctor: I'm sorry to hear that. That's actually one of the reasons I want to get your numbers down. The neuropathy can stabilize and sometimes even improve if we get better glucose control. Now, I want to add another medication called empagliflozin — the brand name is Jardiance. It's an SGLT2 inhibitor that works differently from metformin. It helps your kidneys remove excess sugar through your urine.\n\nPatient: Through my urine? That sounds unusual.\n\nDoctor: It is a different mechanism, but it's very effective. It also has cardiovascular benefits, which is important for someone with diabetes. There are a few side effects to watch for — you may urinate more frequently, and there's a slightly higher risk of urinary tract infections or yeast infections. Make sure you're staying well hydrated.\n\nPatient: OK, I can handle that. Will it replace any of my other medications?\n\nDoctor: No, this is in addition to what you're already taking. So you'll continue the Metformin and the Lantus. We're also going to keep the insulin at 20 units for now, but I want you to be absolutely consistent — every night, no skipping on weekends.\n\nPatient: Got it. What about my diet? My wife and I have been trying, but working at the restaurant makes it hard. There's always food around.\n\nDoctor: I understand that's challenging. Here's what I'd focus on: try to limit your carbohydrate portions, especially refined carbs like white rice, bread, and sugary drinks. Aim for half your plate to be vegetables, a quarter protein, and a quarter complex carbs. Even small changes can make a difference.\n\nPatient: And exercise? I've been walking a bit but not as much as I should.\n\nDoctor: Walking is great. Try to build up to 30 minutes at least five days a week. Even breaking it into two 15-minute walks helps. Exercise directly improves insulin sensitivity, which means your medications work better.\n\nDoctor: Your BMI is 32.4 right now. Even losing 5 to 10 percent of your body weight — that's about 10 to 20 pounds — would significantly improve your blood sugar control and reduce the strain on your joints.\n\nPatient: I'll try, doctor. My knees have been bothering me too, which makes exercise harder.\n\nDoctor: I understand. Start with what's comfortable — walking, swimming if you have access to a pool. The important thing is consistency, not intensity.\n\nDoctor: Now, your kidney function looks good — creatinine is 1.1, which is normal. That's actually one of the reasons I feel comfortable adding the Jardiance, since it does have kidney-protective effects. Your cholesterol is a bit high at 228. We'll monitor that and may need to address it at your next visit.\n\nPatient: When do you want me to come back?\n\nDoctor: Let's schedule a follow-up in three months. We'll repeat your HbA1c then to see if the Jardiance is making a difference alongside better consistency with the insulin and lifestyle changes. Also, I want you to get labs done about a week before that appointment so we have fresh results to review.\n\nPatient: Three months. OK. And about the neuropathy — is there anything I can do for the tingling?\n\nDoctor: For now, keeping your blood sugar controlled is the best treatment. If it's really interfering with your sleep, we can discuss adding a medication like gabapentin at your next visit. But let's see if improved glucose control helps first.\n\nPatient: Sounds good, doctor. Thank you for explaining everything.\n\nDoctor: Of course, Carlos. Remember — consistency is key. The Metformin, the Jardiance, and the insulin every night. And try to make those dietary changes gradually. You don't have to be perfect, just better than yesterday. My nurse will give you the prescription for the Jardiance on your way out. Take care.\n\nPatient: Thank you, Dr. Patel. See you in three months.",
